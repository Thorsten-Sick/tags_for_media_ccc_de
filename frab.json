The SCS will rate online and offline behavior to create a score for each user. One of them is planned to become mandatory in 2020. This lecture will review the current state of governmental and private SCS and different aspects of these systems.",
        "description": "Imagine living in a society where your actions will be rated and formed into a score. Where your online or offline behavior, work performance and attitude towards littering or ignoring red lights will be included in it. And that score will define your job, your ability to get a loan, your general chances, and your life. But don't be scared, it won't be like Orwell's frightening Big Brother. It will be like an all-embracing game, a huge MMORPG. You can do tasks to better your score.\nWhat sounds like dystopian fiction or just a teaser for a \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d episode became a real life option in 2014, when China's Communist Party (CP) published a \u201cPlanning Outline for the Construction of a Social Credit System (2014-2020)\u201d. The CP announced the system to be mandatory for every Chinese person in 2020. It is no theoretical babbling about something happening in a far future: The CP started experimenting with such social credit systems (SCS) in different regions soon after, allowed the private development of such systems, and was cited to become world leader of SCS. While the official goal of the SCS is to level economic development and to bring harmony, sincerity and trust to the whole country, the question is what the \u201cside effects\u201d might be.\n\nStarting with a review of the current state of social credit systems (SCS) in China, examples of their functions and examples of consequences of their existence will be provided. This information will be embedded into a short walk through the People's Republic's Internet landscape, its big players like the BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent), and the CP's digital policies. In the following this will be set it in relation to current ideological turns and the CP's announcement to become the world leader in SCS. \nChina's SCS is seen as an extreme example of a tendency that has developed in most industrialized countries. It displays what can be drawn from the huge amount of information provided by ICTs and so-called \u201csocial media\u201d. And it can show possible consequences of the combination of big data and nearly endless storage on one hand and evaluation by algorithms on the other. From the point of view that this aspect of digitalization is not a problem of the Chinese but for all of us, it will lead to the question how critical thinking and dissenting actions can develop in a reality that is constantly rating behavior to create a score that is defining vast parts of your life. Ending in a discussion on possibilities of big data based social rating and social control and modes of resistance.",

Sich der konzeptionellen Angreifbarkeit der Verfahren bewusst, suchen die Banken ihre Apps durch Speziall\u00f6sungen Dritter abzusichern. Diese Produkte sind mittlerweile zum integralen Bestandteil vieler Banking-Apps geworden und sollen deren Sicherheit im Falle eines kompromittierten Ger\u00e4ts garantieren. \n</p>\n<p>\nIm Finanzbereich allgemein, gerade aber im Feld der deutschen Banking-Apps, ist das sog. <em>Promon SHIELD</em> des norwegischen Herstellers <em>Promon</em> eine bekannte Sicherheitsl\u00f6sung, die durch ihre hohe Beliebtheit bei allen Instituten der deutschen Bankenlandschaft besticht. Insbesondere bei den Apps der Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe und den Volksbanken-Raiffeisenbanken ist das <em>Promon SHIELD</em> mittlerweile zum Dreh- und Angelpunkt der Sicherheitsarchitektur geworden. Als solches findet es sich nicht nur in deren Banking- und pushTAN-Apps, sondern auch in zehn weiteren Apps wieder.

Auch das Bayerische Landesamt f\u00fcr Finanzen, seines Zeichens verantwortlich f\u00fcr <em>Elster</em>, setzt auf <em>Promon</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\nMit <em>Nomorp</em> haben wir ein Werkzeug geschaffen, das die durch das <em>Promon SHIELD</em> eingef\u00fchrten Sicherungs- und H\u00e4rtungsma\u00dfnahmen in weltweit 31 Finanz-Apps vollst\u00e4ndig deaktivieren und zum Teil sogar umkehren kann. <em>Nomorp</em> arbeitet dabei vollautomatisch, ger\u00e4te- und versionsunabh\u00e4ngig. Seine Anwendung f\u00fchrt oft dazu, dass neben klassischer App-H\u00e4rtung auch etablierte Best Practices wie Zertifikats-Pinning oder auch das verschl\u00fcsselte Ablegen von sensiblen Kundendaten nicht mehr existieren.

The design of this handshake was proven secure, and over its 14-year lifetime no weaknesses have been found in it. However, contrary to this history, we show that the 4-way handshake is vulnerable to key reinstallation attacks. In such an attack, the adversary tricks a victim into reinstalling an already in-use key. This is achieved by manipulating and replaying handshake messages. When the victim reinstalls the key, the associated incremental nonce and replay counter is reset to its initial value. Apart from breaking the 4-way handshake, we also show that our key reinstallation attack breaks the group key and Fast BSS Transition (FT) handshake. The impact of our attacks depend on both the handshake being targeted, and the data-confidentiality protocol in use. Simplified, against AES-CCMP, an adversary can replay and decrypt packets, but cannot forge packets. Still, this makes it possible to hijack TCP streams and inject malicious data into them. Against WPA-TKIP and GCMP, the impact is catastrophic: an adversary can replay, decrypt, and forge arbitrary packets. Rather surprisingly, GCMP is especially affected because it uses the same authentication key in both communication directions.\n\nFinally, we confirmed our findings in practice, and found that every Wi-Fi device is vulnerable to some variant of our attacks. Notably, our attack is exceptionally devastating against Android and Linux: it forces the client into using a predictable all-zero encryption key.",

        "description": "Die NGO CADUS steht mit ihrer Arbeit praktisch t\u00e4glich vor der Problemlage, dass die Gesundheit als entscheidender Teil von Gl\u00fcck und Zufriedenheit bis in ihre kleinsten Teilbereiche \u201edurchkapitalisiert\u201c ist. Das hei\u00dft, dass beispielsweise technische Ger\u00e4tschaften, deren Technik an und f\u00fcr sich eher einfach ist und die auf Erkenntnissen basiert, die nicht mehr die Neuesten und l\u00e4ngst nicht mehr als revolution\u00e4r zu bezeichnen sind, extrem teuer sind. \nF\u00fcr viele ist diese Tatsache ganz \u201enormal\u201c. Das ist sie aber nur, weil einerseits der \u201eMythos\u201c der ultra teuren medizinischen Technologie weiter flei\u00dfig von den beteiligten Unternehmen gen\u00e4hrt wird und andererseits diese produzierenden Unternehmen den Markt praktisch global kontrollieren. \n\nDar\u00fcber hinaus sitzen diese medizintechnisch produzierenden Firmen h\u00e4ufig selbst in den entscheidenden Kommissionen und Gremien und k\u00f6nnen so \u00fcber die Marktentwicklung, etwaige Grenzwerte, Abgabezahlen und somit letztlich auch die Preisentwicklung (mit)bestimmen. \n\nDieses praktisch kartellierte oder zumindest dem erh\u00e4rteten Lobbyismusverdacht unterliegende Vorgehen missf\u00e4llt uns deutlich. G\u00fcnstigere L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr bspw. Vitalparametermonitoring k\u00f6nnen dementsprechend somit gar nicht erst produziert werden und auf den Markt kommen. \n\nEin weiteres Beispiel f\u00fcr vornehmlich kapitalistisch-geleitete Zust\u00e4nde in den Bereichen Gesundheit, Versorgung und Krisenintervention, die haupts\u00e4chlich durch Lobbyismus, kontrollierte Marktzug\u00e4nge und maximal gewinnorientiertes Interesse einiger Weniger bestimmt werden, konnte erst k\u00fcrzlich bei der Krisenversorgung nach dem Hurrikan, der weite Teile der Gesellschaft und des Lebens auf Puerto Rico lahmlegte, beobachtet werden. \nDen Hafen von Puerto Rico d\u00fcrfen nur Schiffe unter amerikanischer Flagge anfahren, eine rein wirtschaftsrelevante Regelung. Nach dem Hurrikan kamen durch diese Regelung tagelang weder Wasser, Treibstoff noch andere Hilfslieferungen an, und die  Bev\u00f6lkerung wurde sinnlos weiterem Leid ausgesetzt. \n\nGanz \u00e4hnlich wie das Beispiel der Erstversorgung der Puerto Ricaner*innen nach dem Hurrikan ist auch das dritte Beispiel gelagert: Der Luftraum \u00fcber dem Mittelmeer ist einerseits der weltweit am besten \u00fcberwachte Luftraum; andererseits sehen wir seit Jahren keine Verbesserung in der Seenotrettung Gefl\u00fcchteter. Im Gegenteil \u2013 die Lage spitzt sich immer weiter zu, und immer wieder geraten Boote mit hunderten Menschen darauf in Seenot und unz\u00e4hlige Menschen sterben. \n\nDrei Beispiele, drei L\u00f6sungsans\u00e4tze, wie CADUS und andere Organisationen wie Sea Watch und die HPI Hardware, Dienstleistungen und Informationsfl\u00fcsse hacken, um Krisenintervention und Basisgesundheitsdienstleistungen f\u00fcr alle Menschen m\u00f6glich zu machen. \nIm CADUS-Makerspace in Berlin wird an diversen L\u00f6sungen bereits gebastelt.

        "abstract": "Network cards are often seen as black boxes: you put data in a socket on one side and packets come out at the other end - or the other way around.\nLet's have a deeper look at how a network card actually works at the lower levels by writing a simple user space driver from scratch for a 10 Gbit/s NIC.\n",
        "description": "Packet processing in software is currently undergoing a huge paradigm shift.\nConnection speeds of 10 Gbit/s and beyond created new problems and operating systems couldn't keep keep up.\nHence, there has been a rise of frameworks and libraries working around the kernel, sometimes referred to as kernel bypass or zero copy (the latter is a misnomer). Examples are DPDK, Snabb, netmap, XDP, pf_ring, and pfq.\nThe first part of the talk looks at the background and performance of the kernel network stack and what changes with these new frameworks.\nThey break with all traditional APIs and present new paradigms.\nFor example, they usually provide an application exclusive access to a network interface and exchange raw packets with the app.\nThere are no sockets, they don't even offer a protocol stack.\nHence, they are mostly used for low-level packet processing apps: routers, (virtual) switches, firewalls, and annoying middleboxes \"optimizing\" your connection.\n\nIt's now feasible to write quick prototypes of packet processing and forwarding apps that were restricted to dedicated hardware in the past, enabling everyone to build and test high-speed networking equipment with a low budget.\nThese concepts are slowly creeping into operating systems and software routers/switches: FreeBSD ships with netmap today, XDP is coming to Linux, Open vSwitch can be compiled with a DPDK backend, pfSense is adopting DPDK as well, ...\nWe need to look at the architecture of these frameworks to better understand what is coming for us.\nMost of these frameworks build on the original drivers that have been growing in complexity: a typical driver for a 10 or 40 Gbit/s NIC is in the order of 50,000 lines of code nowadays.\n\n\nHundreds of thousands of lines of code are involved when handling a packet in a typical operating system, and tens of thousands when using one of these new frameworks.\nReading and understanding so much code is quite tedious, so the obvious question is: How hard can it be to implement a driver for a modern 10 Gbit/s NIC from scratch while ignoring all of the existing software layers?\nTurns out that it's not very hard: I've written <a href=\"https://github.com/emmericp/ixy\">ixy</a>, a user space driver for 10 Gbit/s NICs from the Intel 82599 family (X520, X540, X550) from scratch in about 1000 lines of C code.\nThe second part of the talk focuses on user space drivers and the Intel 82599 architecture as it is easy to understand, has a great datasheet, and the core functionality is in the driver as opposed to a magic black-box firmware.\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/emmericp/ixy\">ixy</a> is a full user space driver: you get your raw packets delivered directly into your application and the operating system doesn't even know the NIC exists.\nUser space drivers are also very hackable, you get direct access to the full hardware in your application in user space making it really easy to test out new features, no pesky kernel code needed.\nThis is why it's important to have a simple driver like <a href=\"https://github.com/emmericp/ixy\">ixy</a>: for hacking and educational purposes.\nCore functionality of the driver such as handling DMA buffers is never far away when writing an ixy app: you typically only need to look beneath one layer to see the guts of the driver. For example, when you send out a packet you call a transmit function that directly modifies a ring buffer of DMA descriptors.\n\n\nCheck out the code of <a href=\"https://github.com/emmericp/ixy\">ixy on GitHub</a>!\n\n",

Later that year, I was arrested (and banned from the Internet) for my involvement in LulzSec. Then, in 2014, I discovered through a new Snowden leak[1] that GCHQ had targeted Anonymous and LulzSec, and the person that messaged me was a covert GCHQ employee, pretending to be a hacktivist.\n\nBecause I was myself targeted in the past, I was aware of a key detail, a honeypot URL shortening service setup by GCHQ, that was actually redacted in the Snowden documents published in 2014. This URL shortening service enabled GCHQ to deanonymize another hacktivist and discover his real name and Facebook account, according to the leaked document.\n\nUsing this key detail, I was able to discover a network of sockpuppet Twitter accounts and websites setup by GCHQ, pretending to be activists during the Arab spring of 2011 and Iranian revolution of 2009, and we published an article about it last summer in Motherboard as a piece of investigative journalism.\n\nThis talk will:\n- go into detail about how and why GCHQ setup a network of fake social media accounts, blogs, honeypot proxies and news sites during revolutionary events;\n- reveal new details about other fake websites that GCHQ setup in other parts of the world for different purposes.\n\nThe people responsible, the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG), is a group within GCHQ that has the aim of \"using online techniques to make something happen in the real or cyber world\". To fulfill this aim, a wide but basic array of technological tools and software are used at JTRIG\u2019s disposal, as detailed in the published document titled \"JTRIG tools and techniques\"[2].

Two key questions to ask are: Are the specifications of the Trusted Computing Base correct? And do the implementations match the specifications? I will explore the philosophical challenges and practical steps you can take in answering that question for one of the major dependencies: the hardware your software runs on. I will describe the combination of formal verification and testing that ARM uses to verify the processor specification and I will talk about our current challenge: getting the specification down to zero bugs while the architecture continues to evolve.",
        "description": "This is an overview of the 6 year project to create (and publicly release) formal specifications of the Arm processor architecture.\nThe meat of the talk consists of the things I have done to make the specification correct:\n- testing the specification with the test programs that Arm uses as part of the sign-off criteria for processors\n- formally validating processor pipelines against the specification (which has the side-effect of finding bugs in the spec)\n- formally verifying properties of the specification\n- getting lots of different users - they all find different bugs\nThere are a lot of things that you can do with a formal specification: binary analysis, proving compilers or OSes correct, driving a superoptimizer, etc. so I hope that this will inspire the audience to go off and do something amazing with Arm's specification.",

We investigate the communicative developments underlying this rise. Using web-scraping and automated content analysis, we collected over 10.000 articles from mainstream-news and far-right blogs, along with over 90GBs of Tweets and thousands of Facebook-Posts. This allows us a deep insight into how public discourse works in 2017 Germany.",
        "description": "The Bundestagswahl 2017 was an earthquake to Germany's political landscape. With the AfD an illiberal and openly xenophobic party became the third-largest force in parliament. Its rise over just four years is unlike anything seen in Germany before. \nThe new media landscape has often been touted as a key component of the rise of the AfD. More than any other party the AfD has made frequent use of the \"populist playbook\" -- stirring controversy through inflammatory rhetoric before back-pedalling and slamming  the \"L\u00fcgenpresse\" (mendacious press). More than this, though, no other party has been as successful in directly connecting to and communicating with followers on Facebook to spread their \"real\" messaging outside mainstream media channels. Likewise, the proliferation of distinctly right-wing, rabble-rousing \"news\"-blogs and spread of these \"news\" on social media have given the far right an unfiltered platform to communicate with supporters. This has fundamentally shaken what scholars know about mass communication and agenda setting processes during elections.\nStill, despite many analyses and investigations we do not really know what actually went on during the 2017 campaign in Germany. Lots of attention has been devoted to the question if the AfD received too much space for presenting itself vis-a-vis the other parties in mainstream and social media channels. Yet, to our knowledge, no systematic investigation of these dynamics has been undertaken in Germany. We attempt here to undertake this investigation.\nStarting in early July of 2017 we used Python-based automated web scraping to access eight German-language \"news\"-blogs popular within networks of the extreme political right. Between July and September we collected almost 4500 articles from these right-leaning sites. In addition, using the Facebook-Graph-API we collected the shares and likes of each post from the Facebook-presences of those same blogs (where available). Simultaneously, we also collected mainstream media content. Using the Factiva and Lexis-Nexis news databases, we downloaded and parsed almost 6000 texts from both print as well as online media for the same period of time. Finally, to help capture public sentiment during the campaign, we collected all German tweets from Mid-August onward (roughly 90 GBs of data) alongside Google search trends data.\nThe texts from these three ecosystems - right-wing fringe blogs, mainstream media, and public internet search and sentiment data - serve as data to use automated content analysis, build topic and machine learning models, and run time series cross sectional analyses to understand the possible relationships between and within each area. This allows us to understand the co-integrated processes between media/public spheres and identify what was talked about, when it was talked about, and how it was talked about.\nOverall these data allow us to paint picture of campaign discourse in Germany. We can present answers to a number of questions: Did the AfD actually receive a disproportionate amount of attention? Do these separate media ecosystems influence one another? Who leads, who follows? How do political elites interact with the public via old and new media? Who is driving topics? Overall, this project presents a snapshot of the campaigning season for Germany in the year 2017. We unveil the dynamics brought about by new forms of public discourse.\n\n============\nAbout the researchers who collected and analysed this data:\nAlexander Beyer initially attended Eberhard-Karls-University in T\u00fcbingen, and is now a PhD-student at <A HREF=\"http://www.sfu.ca/politics.html\">Simon-Fraser-University</A>in Vancouver.

        "abstract": "Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), like those based on ARM TrustZone or Intel SGX, intend to provide a secure way to run code beyond the typical reach of a computer\u2019s operating system.\nHowever, when trusted and untrusted code runs on shared hardware, it opens the door to the same microarchitectural attacks that have been exploited for years. This talk provides an overview of these attacks as they have been applied to TEEs, and it additionally demonstrates how to mount these attacks on common TrustZone implementations. Finally, we identify new techniques which allow us to peer within TrustZone TEEs with greater resolution than ever before.",
        "description": "The goals of this talk are twofold. First, it will build up an understanding of microarchitectural attacks, Trusted Execution Environments, and the existing research into the two. The talk assumes only basic knowledge of processor operation, and presents the information needed to understand the many variants of attacks against the cache and more. We will also cover key similarities and differences between ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX technologies and how these can be abused by microarchitectural attacks. This is a relatively new field of research, but it is growing quickly, and we hope to explain the significant contributions and accomplishments that have been achieved already.\n\nThe second goal of the talk is to demonstrate how to perform these attacks in practice. We will take the TrustZone-based TEE implementation on the Nexus 5X as an example and explain how to write software which performs these side-channel attacks. We then push beyond the existing research and develop new methods to perform attacks on ARM TrustZone with greater precision than seen before. Our setup is relatively easy to implement, and we aim for this demonstration to encourage and enable further research into the software running within these trusted environments.\n\nBy the end of the talk, the audience will recognize the risks presented by microarchitectural attacks and the ease with which issues can be exploited. We hope to leave the audience appreciating the tension between processor security and performance and understanding the difficulty of truly securing a Trusted Execution Environment from this powerful class of attack.",

This talk explains \"everything about the AGC\", including its quirky but clever hardware design, its revolutionary OS, and how its software allowed humans to reach and explore the moon. \n",
        "description": "The AGC was an early digital computer specifically designed for the Apollo moon missions. The Command Module and the Lunar Module each contained one AGC. First built in 1965 from 5600 integrated circuits, it was one of the first minicomputers, beating commercial machines like the PDP-8 in weight (32 kg) and power consumption (55 W). The Apollo program's size and weight limitations as well as the requirements for real-time guidance, navigation and control were pushing 1960s technologies to their limits. As a 15 bit one's complement big-endian accumulator machine with 36 kilo-words of ROM and 2 kilo-words of RAM, its design seems very foreign from today's perspective. The operating system was real-time, priority-based cooperative/preemptive and fault-tolerant, supporting interpreted virtual machines \u2013 practically inventing many of these concepts.\n\nThis talk explains all the hardware details of the AGC: Its machine language, counters, timers, I/O, display and keyboard, as well as its implementation using integrated circuits, core memory and \"core rope\" ROM. The talk goes on to explain the software: interrupt handling, the core set, the wait list, the alarm system, the interpreter, and the actual user software, providing, among other things, guidance, navigation and control (GNC) services.\n\nThe audience will get a good understanding of hardware and software design in the 1960s, and appreciate the innovations driven by the Apollo program.",

        "description": "Formal hardware verification (hardware model checking) can prove that a design has a specified property. This is different from simulation, which can only demonstrate that a property holds for some concrete traces (sets of inputs). Historically only very simple properties in simple designs have been provable this way, but improvements in model checkers over the last decade enable us to prove very complex design properties nowadays.\n\nriscv-formal is a framework for formally verifying RISC-V processors directly against a formal ISA specification. (The ISA specification used in riscv-formal is itself formally verified against Spike , the official RISC-V simulator and \"golden reference\" implementation.) riscv-formal can be made to work with any existing processor design, all that is needed is to add an additional RVFI (RISC-V formal interface) trace port to the core.\n\nriscv-formal by default uses the open source SymbiYosys toolchain to perform the formal proofs, but it should be compatible with all major HDL formal verification flows.\n\nIn this presentation I will discuss how the complex task of verifying a processor against the ISA specification is broken down into smaller verification problems in riscv-formal, how to implement RVFI, how integrate a core with riscv-formal, and what kind of bugs can be detected using our method.\n\nMost of the proofs performed by riscv-formal are bounded proofs, i.e. it is only proven that the properties hold for the first N cycles after reset. But with a sufficiently large N we can create high confidence that in fact all relevant states can be reached within the bound of the proof and that therefore the bounded case is a sufficient proxy for the more general unbounded case. Abstractions, cut-points, and blackboxing can further help extend the effective bound of the proof. The presentation also touches on those techniques.",

        "abstract": "My talk explores the interconnected nature of war and culture. It does so through the context of technology and political discourse in contemporary art. With a view from the battle fields of the Middle East, both real and imagined, I attempt to dissect how the political discourse of academia and the art world trickles down to everyday discussions. A simple word such as \"assassination\" becomes rife with racism when its etymology can be linked to anti-Muslim propaganda that originated during the Crusades. And today assassination is the primary political tool of the West to negotiate with Muslim radicals, even violating their own rules of citizenship, constitutional, and human rights protections in the process. With this backdrop, we see how the artistic works of such diverse artists such as Chris Marker, Chris Burden, Haroun Farouki, Anish Kapoor, and Banksy have evolved to reflect the political discourse of the moment. The digital advancements of the war zone, I argue, are reflected in the diametrically opposed peaceful spaces of the gallery, museum, or art house cinema. As the digital defeats analogue, the act of killing becomes disconnected from the killer, with democracies spreading thei blame over systemic failures rather than facing the reality of death.     ",

Scientific incentive structures like the Impact Factor prefer sensational results more than rigorous scientific standards.\n\nBut there's also some move into the right direction.

The modelling decisions underlying this data-driven algorithmic science evaluation are, among other things, the outcome of a specific power structure in the science system. Power relations are especially visible, when negotiated during processes of boundary work. Therefore, we use the discourse on 'citation cartels', to shed light on a specific perception of fairness in the scientific system, as well as on the actors who are in charge. While doing so, we draw analogies to the discourse on search engine optimization.",
        "description": "Scientific evaluation as governance technique is conducted through different instruments which have intended and unintended effects. One aspect of evaluation is the measurement of research quality through the performance of scientific publications, for example, how often they are cited. The design of such performance indicators is one core task of bibliometrics as a discipline.\n\nThere is incidence that citation-based performance indicators might have side effects on citation behaviour. Those effects have to be considered by the bibliometrics community. On the one hand, they have to be considered with regard to indicator design aiming at achieving validity of measurement. On the other hand, and maybe more important, they have to be considered with regard to indicator use and its effect on science and society.\n\nWe find some of this behavioural adaptation analogously in the development of search engine optimization (SEO). Search engine rankings share one core principle with citation-based indicators: that relevance (quality) is understood to be measurable through incoming links (citations) to a website (publication). The discourse on SEO and which strategies are to be regarded as white hat SEO or black hat SEO led to a more or less stable set of 'allowed' activities, which are approved by the search engine monopolist Google.\n\nCitation-based performance indicators are also the aim of optimization activities. One activity, which is believed to be undertaken by scientific journals, is the establishment of 'citation cartels' (groups of journals, which agree on mutually citing each other to boost their indicators). This form of strategic citation is widely regarded as morally corrupt. Beyond this specific type, there is an ongoing debate, which citation strategies are to be regarded scientific misconduct, and therefore threatening the 'fairness' of performance indicators.\n\nIn our talk, we will outline the discourse on strategic citation with examples, which show concerns or label some strategies as unethical, and some which demand detection and punishment of questionable behaviour. We especially point out that the request to embank strategic citation is often addressed to the publication database provider Thomson Reuters. Proceeding from this point, this opens up a new perspective on power structures in the science system.",

So, how do we know the amount of ice melting in the arctic or how much rain is falling in the Amazon? Are groundwater aquifers stable or are they are being depleted? Are these regular seasonal changes or is there a trend? How can we even measure these phenomena on a global scale?\n\nThis talk will provide one possible answer: gravity.",
        "description": "The melting of ice during the summer and the regrowth of ice shields in winter or any variation of mass on the surface of the Earth and inside the Earth, in general, are reflected in the change of its gravity field. By monitoring the gravity field from space, we can infer the mass variations necessary to result in the measured gravity changes. Satellite missions like GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) offer us a monthly view of the Earth's changing gravity field since 2002. Providing a look into the mass redistribution driven geophysical processes, climate, and human civilisation. Furthermore, the combination of gravity with additional types of measurements allows us to get a better understanding of our planet.  \nThe objective of this presentation is not to discuss the last significant decimal in some indicator of climate change. A look at the gravity field offers much more information, e. g., continental and global hydrology, changing ocean currents, mass flow in the mantle. This talk will give a brief introduction into space geodetic techniques used to monitor the gravity field of the Earth with a focus on the GRACE mission, its scientific results and applications. I will explain their working principle and the process which leads to a mathematical representation of the gravity field. We will look at a few selected examples, and try to answer the questions as mentioned above. Fortunately, the necessary data products are freely available. Additionally, there are services which spare us the math and offer tools to generate visualisations for a straightforward approach to this topic.",

        "description": "Current medical imaging machines such as MRI scanners are large, expensive and very rarely used preventatively as scans are done when symptoms have already occurred. A better healthcare for the future would include affordable high resolution body scans for everyone, which caused no harm to the body and enable us to track changes through machine learning algorithms. \n\nElectrical Impedance Tomography is an electrical current mapping technique enabling the reconstruction of 2D slices of the human body that is both non-invasive and completely safe (non-ionizing). It\u2019s an exciting and active area of research with new techniques coming out all the time to reach higher resolution imaging. The range of applications are huge and include measuring lung volume, muscle and fat mass, gestural recognition based on muscle movement, bladder or stomach fullness, breast and kidney cancer, hemorrhage detection and even monitoring the depth of anesthesia in patients. I\u2019ll talk about the state of research on each of these applications. \n\nCurrently there is no readily available platform to enable rapid development and collaboration in this area. Unfortunately this means very few people outside of biomedical engineering R&D have been able to experiment with it. This talk presents a new system in development that enables real-time electrical impedance tomography experimentation. I will present the hardware, python test bench and explanation of how the reconstruction algorithms work, then move to potential future directions and applications of this project. \n\nDemocratizing novel sensing technology opens the way to better collaborations and faster innovation to increase human healthspan.\n",

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "Activists in Saudi Arabia have been able to celebrate important victories like the recent lifting of the ban on women driving in September 2017 but have to fight on a lot of other front lines at the same time. Websites are blocked on a large scale and many activists are sent to jail on the grounds of a loosely used cybercrime law. This talk will give some insight into the current social and political strife happening on the Saudi Internet from a first-hand-perspective using some of the data collected in a collaboration with the OONI project.",
        "description": "There is a simple reason why the Internet and social media have such an important role in the current struggle for social and political change: About 75 percent of the Saudi population are younger than 30 years old and basically everyone is online all the time: 75 percent of the Saudis have a smartphone and Saudi Twitter users account for 40 percent of all Twitter users in the whole Arab world. \n\nLife in the Kingdom is strongly influenced by the conflict between conservative-religious groups on one side and liberal activists on the other side who are trying to further democratic values, women's rights, free speech and freedom of religion. While the government is restricting public discourse, activists are pushing for reforms and are trying to make their voices heard.\n\nThis activism and so-called \u201eoverstepping of red lines\u201c comes at a price: Many have heard of the blogger Raif Badawi, who has been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia since 2012 and sentenced to 10 years in jail and 600 lashes for setting up a website that criticises religious figures. But fewer people are familiar with the cases of activists like Waleed Abulkhair, Ashraf Fayadh, Hamza Kashgari, Mariam al-Otaibi, Loujain AlHathloul and many others who are often charged and sentenced to prison for tweets or websites that they have put up under a very elastic clause in Saudi Arabias cyber crime law.\n\nThis talk strives to give some insight into the darkness of the current state of affairs on the Saudi internet as well as to show some of the rays of hope:\n\n1) We will have a look at Saudi Arabias cyber crime law which was instituted in 2007 and has since been amended multiple times: Now online newspapers and bloggers have to obtain a license and the government can monitor social media platforms to subsequently charge people for cyber crime or cyber terrorism for \u201epromoting\u201c adultery, homosexuality, atheism or criticizing the government or religious figures.\n\n2) While living in Saudi Arabia I collaborated with the OONI Project (Open Observatory of Network Interference: https://ooni.torproject.org/) to take measure of the extent of censorship and blocked websites in the Kingdom. In this talk we'll look at the method that I used to collect this data as well as the gathered information and what we can conclude from this about the state of Internet censorship in Saudi Arabia.\n\n3) And finally: Not all is lost. With years of relentless social media campaigns and the online organization of protest and dissent, activists are despite all the hardships they have suffered able to celebrate victories from time to time - like the recent lifting of the ban on women driving or the first participation of women in local elections.",

Like Tor, mix networks protect metadata by using layered encryption and routing packets between a series of independent nodes. Mix networks resist vastly more powerful adversary models than Tor though, including global passive adversaries. In so doing, mix networks add both latency and cover traffic. We shall outline the basic components of a mix network, touch on their roles in resisting active and passive attacks, and discuss how the latency impacts reliability, application design, and user experience.",
        "description": "Interest in privacy technologies has surged over the previous decade, due in part to the Snowden revelations as well as earlier revelations of warrantless wiretaping by the NSA.  Tor has justifiably received considerable attention for protecting location metadata when using existing Internet protocols.  We believe the time is right though to deploy far stronger systems that cover more specific use cases, especially email and monetary transactions.\n\nThere are serious limitations to the adversary models addressed by Tor, which manifests today as website fingerprinting attacks, but easily extend to devastating attacks on most use cases, including messaging systems like Briar and Ricochet. \n\nAcademics have proposed various anonymity technologies with far stronger threat models than Tor, but by far the most deployable and efficient option remains mix networks, which date to the founding of anonymity research by David Chaum in 1981.  Tor was inspired by mix networks and shares some superficial similarities, but mix networks' are vastly stronger if they judiciously add latency and cover traffic.\n\nThere are several historical reasons why mixnets lost popularity and why Tor's onion routing won. Namely, Tor is\nlow latency and really good at being usable. This is in contrast to mix networks which are essentially an unreliable packet switching network. Historically mix networks achieved enough mix entropy by using long delays whereas it is becoming more widely understood that there exists a tradeoff between legit traffic, decoy traffic and latency.\n\nWe believe a strong anonymity network is urgently needed so that individuals can retain a core of control over what metadata they expose to traffic analysis. We further suspect the world is ready to pay for deploying it, and developing the specialized applications to exploit it, both for messaging privacy and for privacy preserving financial systems like ZCash or Taler.",

        "description": "<p>Few years ago Samsung Galaxy S3 devices started dying all around the world (a phenomenon known as \"Galaxy S3 Sudden Death\"). The faulty hardware was pinpointed to its eMMC chip (made by Samsung). eMMC are basically SD cards in BGA form soldered to the PCB, but as it apperas - they hide a CPU and a firmware inside.</p>\n<p>Samsung eMMC chips support some vendor-specific, undocumented eMMC commands. By doing some guesswork and finding the right sequence of commands I was able to dump the entire RAM (and firmware) of the eMMC chip, which appears to sport an <i>ARM Cortex-M3</i> chip inside. But how can we know what causes the device to fail?</p>\n<p>Samsung has written a Linux patch which patches the eMMC's RAM in order to fix the problem. However, investigating the patch itself reveals that it does nothing more than jumping to an infinite loop when something goes wrong. We needed a more inherent fix. By utilizing Samsung's own vendor-specific commands, we can write the eMMC's RAM in order to achieve code execution, or even write to the eMMC's NAND flash memory directly. We can update its firmware and fix the problem altogether.</p>\n<p>However, when a device is bricked, how do we even get to send commands to its soldered eMMC chip by software-only means? I will show a working exploit against Samsung's boot-loader to be able to send commands to the eMMC chip.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this is not enough. A bricked device usually means that the eMMC is now in an infinite loop and won't accept and eMMC commands. Although it appears to be a dead-end, there's a way: by triggering a power reset on the eMMC chip, there's a time window in which the chip boots itself. There's a way to stop the eMMC chip from loading its own firmware, instead putting itself in some \"recovery mode\". I was finally able to execute my own code on the faulty chip.</p>\n<p>The research not only applies to Galaxy S3 devices (which are obviously old), as it appears to be relevant for new Samsung eMMC chips, even though they have a slightly different firmware, which will be briefly overviewed.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Carry bugs are fairly common, and usually too small to have big impact, or so they are considered. This one was no exception.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20040\">Go issue #20040</a> affected the optimized x86_64 assembly implementation of scalar multiplication on the NIST P-256 elliptic curve in the standard library.</p>\n\n<p><code>p256SubInternal</code> computes <code>x - y mod p</code>. In order to be constant time it has to do both the math for <code>x &gt;= y</code> and for <code>x &lt; y</code>, it then chooses the result based on the carry bit of <code>x - y</code>. The old code chose wrong (<code>CMOVQNE</code> vs <code>CMOVQEQ</code>), but most of the times compensated by adding a carry bit that didn't belong in there (<code>ADCQ</code> vs <code>ANDQ</code>). Except when it didn't, once in a billion times (when <code>x - y &lt; 2^256 - p</code>). <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/commit/9294fa2749ffee7edbbb817a0ef9fe633136fa9c\">The whole patch is 5 lines.</a></p>\n\n<p>The bug was found by a Cloudflare engineer because it caused ECDSA verifications to fail erroneously but the security impact was initially unclear. We devised an adaptive bug attack that can recover a scalar input to <code>ScalarMult</code> by submitting attacker-controlled points and checking if the result is correct. Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman involves a secret scalar, a peer-provided point, and fails to establish a key if the result is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>We reported this to the Go team, Go 1.7.6 and 1.8.2 were issued and the vulnerability was assigned <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8932\">CVE-2017-8932</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At a high level, this P-256 ScalarMult implementation processes the scalar in blocks of 5 bits. We can precompute points that trigger the bug for each specific 5 bit value, and submit them. When the protocol fails, we learned 5 key bits, and we move on to the next 5, Hollywood style. In about 500 submissions on average we recover the whole key.</p>\n\n<p>The precomputation involves a lot of unusable points and edge cases, but by modifying the optimized assembly implementation and generating points intelligently, we can produce a full round of points in seconds on 1000 machines (or spot instances). Each round depends on the previous ones, so must be computed live during each attack.</p>\n\n<p>Normal ECDH does not offer an attacker multiple attempts against the same scalar, making the attack impossible. However, a variant of ECDH with a static scalar is used as a public key encryption scheme, for example in JSON Web Encryption. The attack can fully recover the private key in that scenario.</p>\n\n<p>No bug is small enough.</p>",

This talk will effectively map out how the Internet continues to be a tight and controlled space in Iran, and what efforts are being done and can be done to make the Iranian Internet a more accessible and secure space.\n\nBreak down of the talk:\n\nWhat threats exist for Iranians online?\nA discussion of the various bodies that police the Internet in Iran will be discussed, including the Iranian Cyber Police (FATA), Gerdab (the Revolutionary Guards Cyber Police), and the loosely affiliated government network of the Iranian Cyber Army, and how they have been tracking, arresting, and hacking into the online activities of various Iranians inside and outside of the country.\n\nGovernment Internet policies\nThe talk will briefly overview the quagmire that is Internet policy and law, including the bodies that regulate the Internet, such as the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, and various laws such as the Cyber Crimes Laws, the censorship of various encryption tools, new policies on censorship and data collection, and the Internet policies under the new Minister of ICT, Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi, a former member of the Ministry of Intelligence and architect of Iran\u2019s online surveillance infrastructure. \n\nForeign Technology Companies\nApple is not officially present in Iran, and does not want to get involved in financial transactions with Iranian banks. As a result, it\u2019s been removing the applications of Iranians off it\u2019s app store, to the detriment of all lot of Internet services Iranians with iPhones can access. Telegram has long been rumoured to be cooperating with the Iranian government. This past year they moved their CDN servers inside Iran, citing concerns for the security of Telegram data from the Iranian government. Telegram is one of the only social media platforms not censored in Iran, but now Iran\u2019s hardline politicians are threatening to sue Pavel Durov. Additionally, the new Minister of ICT has said they will be engaging Twitter in negotiations to unfilter the platform in Iran. Twitter is refusing to comment on whether they are engaging or will work with the government. This portion of the talk will try to understand the dangers and responsibilities companies have to keeping the Internet safe and accessible to Iranians. ",

During its evaluation, BootStomp discovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities across 4 different bootloaders. Finally BootStomp has been open-sourced to help the security community.",
        "description": "Modern mobile bootloaders play an important role in both the function and the security of the device. They help ensure the Chain of Trust (CoT), where each stage of the boot process verifies the integrity and origin of the following stage before executing it. This process, in theory, should be immune even to attackers gaining full control over the operating system, and should prevent persistent compromise of a device\u2019s CoT. However, not only do these bootloaders necessarily need to take untrusted input from an attacker in control of the OS in the process of performing their function, but also many of their verification steps can be disabled (\u201cunlocked\u201d) to allow for development and user customization. Applying traditional analyses on bootloaders is problematic, as hardware dependencies hinder dynamic analysis, and the size, complexity, and opacity of the code involved preclude the usage of many previous techniques.\n\nIn this paper, we explore vulnerabilities in both the design and implementation of mobile bootloaders. We examine bootloaders from four popular manufacturers, and discuss the standards and design principles that they strive to achieve. We then propose BootStomp , a multi-tag taint analysis resulting from a novel combination of static analyses and dynamic symbolic execution, designed to locate problematic areas where input from an attacker in control of the OS can compromise the bootloader\u2019s execution, or its security features. Using our tool, we find six previously-unknown vulnerabilities (of which five have been confirmed by the respective vendors), as well as rediscover one that had been previously reported. Some of these vulnerabilities would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as part of the bootloader (thus compromising the entire chain of trust), or to perform permanent denial-of-service attacks. Our tool also identified two bootloader vulnerabilities that can be leveraged by an attacker with root privileges on the OS to unlock the device and break the CoT. We conclude by proposing simple mitigation steps that can be implemented by manufacturers to safeguard the bootloader and OS from all of the discovered attacks, using already-deployed hardware features.",

Heute ist es anders herum\u201c. Gr\u00fcnde daf\u00fcr scheinen eine geradezu magische Technikgl\u00e4ubigkeit, ein merkw\u00fcrdiges Missverst\u00e4ndnis der Funktionsweise heutiger Computer, ein immer gr\u00f6\u00dfer werdender finanzieller Druck auf die \u00f6ffentliche Hand und ein weit verbreitetes, technisch-reduziertes \u2013 man k\u00f6nnte fast sagen 'kybernetisches' \u2013 Welt- und Menschenbild zu sein.\n\nDa gewinnt Googles k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz Alpha-Go gegen den professionellen s\u00fcdkoreanischen Go-Spieler Lee Sedol und schon wird der Abgesang auf das menschliche Gehirn angestimmt. Doch dass Sedol f\u00fcr das Match ein paar Tassen Kaffee verstoffwechselte, aber Alpha-Go die Energie einer Kleinstadt, zeigt, dass die Lage geringf\u00fcgig komplizierter ist. \u00c4hnliche fehlleitende Ungenauigkeiten finden sich auch bez\u00fcglich der ber\u00fchmten Geheimsprache der Facebook-Bots bis hin zu den M\u00f6glichkeiten von \u201esmart contracts\u201c in der Blockchain. Dies sind Beispiele, wie missverstandene Computerf\u00e4higkeiten und Fehlzuschreibungen eine tats\u00e4chlich sinnvolle Diskussion \u00fcber den Nutzen weltweit vernetzter Computersysteme verhindern.\n\nDerartige Diskussionen sind jedoch mitnichten rein akademisch oder philosophisch, sondern in der Wirkung gesellschaftlich hoch brisant. Denn wie an der aktuellen Predictive-Policing-Thematik zu erkennen ist, erzeugt der Glaube an die \u00dcberlegenheit der Technik nunmehr harte soziale Realit\u00e4ten f\u00fcr die betroffenen 'Datenopfer', aber keine nennenswerten positiven Ergebnisse f\u00fcr die Sicherheit. Gleiches gilt f\u00fcr die automatisierte, sogenannte \u201eintelligente\u201c, Video\u00fcberwachung mit Verhaltenserkennung, die perspektivisch fl\u00e4chendeckend in Deutschland angedacht ist: der Glaube an solche Systeme vergr\u00f6\u00dfert zwar immens den Kassenstand der Hersteller und Anbieter, aber verkleinert in gleicher Weise die Freiheit und Freir\u00e4ume eines jeden Menschen im \u00f6ffentlichen Raum. Genau das sind die tats\u00e4chlichen Auswirkungen eines unwidersprochenen, blinden Computeroptimismus', der zudem von finanziellen Motivationen getrieben ist und in der Folge kontinuierlich unsere Gesellschaft umpr\u00e4gt.\n\nF\u00fcr eine Digitalisierung im Sinne der Freiheit und der gesellschaftlichen Weiterentwicklung m\u00fcssen die Erwartungen an die Informatik folglich neu justiert werden und das im Zusammenhang mit wirtschaftlichen und politischen Machtverh\u00e4ltnissen.\n\n\n<span style=\"color:grey;\"><strong id=\"langderr\">EN</strong>: The well-known computer pioneer and society critic Prof. Dr. Joseph Weizenbaum once said, \"Once upon a time, a problem was presented to the computer after it was understood. Today it's the other way around.\" Reasons for this seem to be an almost magical belief in technology, a strange misunderstanding of the functioning of today's computers, an ever-increasing financial pressure on the public sector and a widespread, technically-reduced \u2013 one could almost say 'cybernetic' \u2013 world view and concept of what's human.\n\nNot only since Google's artificial intelligence Alpha-Go won against the professional South Korean Go player Lee Sedol many techno-optimists celebrate the inferiority of the human brain. But Sedol metabolized a few cups of coffee for the match whereas Alpha-Go needed the energy of a small town; this shows that the matter is slightly more complicated. Similar misleading inaccuracies can be found regarding the 'famous' secret language of the Facebook bots or regarding the possibilities of \"smart contracts\" in the blockchain. These are examples of how misunderstood computer abilities and faulty ascription prevent a meaningful debate on the benefits of globally networked computer systems.\n\nHowever, such discussions are by no means purely academic or philosophical; they are socially highly explosive in their effect. As can be seen from the current addoption of Predictive Policing, the belief in the superiority of technology now creates harsh social realities for the affected 'data victims', but no noteworthy positive results for actual public security. The same applies to the automated \"intelligent\" video surveillance systems with behavioral detection \u2013 probably rolled-out nationwide in Germany: the belief in such systems immensely increases the cash influx of manufacturers and suppliers, but at the same time it reduces the freedom of each person in public space. These are the actual effects of an unchallenged 'blind computer optimism' driven by financial motivations which consequently transforms our society.\n\nFor a Digitalization supporting freedom and social development, expectations of information technology must be readjusted in the context of economic and political power relations.</span>",

        "description": "Der Vortrag bietet einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die aktuellen Entwicklungen in den Bereichen K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz und Maschinelles Lernen. Der Fokus liegt dabei vor allem auf der zumeist unbewussten Beeinflussung von Nutzerinnen und Nutzern durch personalisierte Nachrichtenempfehlungen, fake news sowie Bild-, Audio- und Videomanipulation. Die Forschung zeigt, dass ein Gro\u00dfteil der Nutzerinnen und Nutzer von sozialen Netzwerken wie Facebook sich der Tatsache, dass ihre Nachrichten zunehmend von Algorithmen ausgew\u00e4hlt und eingeschr\u00e4nkt werden, nicht bewusst ist. Wir erkunden, welche Folgen diese gl\u00e4sernen Echokammern haben und wie leicht sie Nutzerinnen und Nutzer beeinflussen k\u00f6nnen.\nEin Gro\u00dfteil der Daten, die diese Beeinflussung erm\u00f6glichen, entstehen dabei unbewusst und beil\u00e4ufig. Sie k\u00f6nnen aber R\u00fcckschl\u00fcsse auf Vorlieben und Verhalten der Nutzerinnen und Nutzer erm\u00f6glichen. Wie banal diese Daten sein k\u00f6nnen, veranschaulicht der Versuch von Banken, Kreditw\u00fcrdigkeit anhand von Postleitzahlen vorherzusagen. Ein ambitioniertes Beispiel bietet Prof. Dr. Michal Kosinski, ein Psychologe aus Stanford, der behauptet, dass er die sexuelle Orientierung eines Menschen an seinem Gesicht erkennen kann.\nDie Beispiele zeigen wie die statistischen Werkzeuge des Maschinellen Lernens zunehmend von Laien verwendet werden, die die Richtigkeit ihrer Vorhersagen nur bedingt einsch\u00e4tzen k\u00f6nnen und die die Grenzen der Werkzeuge nicht hinreichend verstehen. Nichtsdestotrotz werden zunehmend Entscheidungen automatisiert auf Basis von Daten getroffen. Diese Entscheidungen treffen dabei vordergr\u00fcndig Algorithmen, die objektiv scheinen. Sie lernen aber alle Verzerrungen (Biases), die in den Daten angelegt sind. Alarmierendes Beispiel hierf\u00fcr ist die Nutzung von Algorithmen im US-Justizsystem, wo eine Risikosoftware namens COMPAS systematisch Wei\u00dfe bevorteilt und Afroamerikaner benachteiligt.\nZiel des Vortrages ist es, M\u00f6glichkeiten der Beeinflussung durch K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz aufzuzeigen und Zuh\u00f6rerinnen und Zuh\u00f6rer in die Lage zu versetzen, Chancen und Gefahren dieser Entwicklungen zu bewerten.",

        "abstract": "Microcode is an abstraction layer on top of the physical components of a CPU and present in most general-purpose CPUs today. While it is well-known that CPUs feature a microcode update mechanism, very little is known about its inner workings given that microcode and the update mechanism itself are proprietary and have not been throughly analyzed yet. We close this gap by both analyzing microcode and writing our own programs for it. This talk will give an insight into our results and how we achieved them, including live demos of what we can do and technical details.",
        "description": "Given the complexity of modern instruction sets hardware vendors moved to hardware designs incorporating complex decode units. A single instruction of the complex outwardfacing instruction set is translated to multiple instructions of the simpler internal architecture. While it is possible to do this translation in hardware alone, some instructions would require huge amounts of space on the silicon and increase costs. These complex instructions are instead decoded using a software-like approach called microcode. While processing such an instruction, the CPU internally evaluates a sequence of operations, micro-ops, which decode the complex instruction into the corresponding simpler operations that are performed by the hardware.\n\nIn the light of the existence of hardware bugs such as the infamous Pentium fdiv bug, hardware vendors developed a process to fix those errors without requiring a CPU replacement. However the microcode is stored in a ROM on the CPU die and can not be changed after production. Also relatively simple or often used instructions are still decoded in hardware. The update is instead achieved using microcode updates, which intercept certain instructions and replace their faulty implementation with a new, fixed version. These updates are applied either by the BIOS/UEFI or the operating system during early bootup. While the update process is well documented, the Linux kernel offers a module for it, and the updates are provided by the CPU vendors, the actual semantics of microcode are proprietary.\n\nMost update mechanisms are protected by signatures or other cryptographic primitives. However there were some indications that older CPU models (until around 2013) do not have a strong cryptographic protection and thus would accept custom updates. Given this chance we started to analyze the behavior of the CPU given our own updates and used these observations to infer the semantics of microcode. After some time we reverse-engineered enough of the semantics to write our own microcode programs. These programs range from very simple proof of concepts to stealthy backdoors and defensive primitives.\n\nAs an additional approach we also performed hardware analysis. By delayering the CPU and imaging it with both an optical and an electron microscope we could locate and read out the ROM containing the microcode. After processing and reordering the physical connections we retrieved the hardwired microcode of the CPU. This gave us more information on what can be done with microcode and allowed more insights into the intended behavior than our reverse-engineering approach.\n\nIn this talk we will first start with a (short) crash course in CPU architecture and where microcode is used in practice. We will then cover our reverse engineering methods and how we were able to discover the semantics of x86 microcode. We then demonstrate, also with live demos, this knowledge with multiple microcode programs that implement both defensive measures as well as provide an attacker with hard to detect backdoors. Lastly we will discuss security problems and possible solutions to protect against them. We also provide example microcode programs for your own CPUs (use at your own risk) and a kernel patch to apply them on a Linux system. Also we will have some systems with us so you can try your hand at writing some microcode yourself.\n",

        "description": "It\u2019s an exciting time for public-key cryptography. With the threat of practical quantum computers looming in the next few decades, it\u2019s high time to replace the systems that can be broken by a quantum computer with ones that remain secure even if the attacker has a quantum computer. However, this is easier said than done \u2013 there is no consensus what replacements should be chosen and how secure the systems are. NIST has just started a 5-7 year competition with the target to recommend a portfolio of post-quantum encryption and signature schemes. Considerations will be speed, bandwidth, and of course security.\n\nSeveral of the submissions are based on lattices. At our current level of understanding, lattice-based cryptography offers relatively small public keys for both encryption and signatures, while having good performance and reasonably sized ciphertexts and signatures. While these features are nice and make us want to know more about lattices, that world can be a scary place full of discussions of Minkowski bounds, Gaussian distributions, and orthogonalized bases. We will show how these schemes work in accessible terms.\n\nLattices have been used in cryptography for more than thirty years, but for most of that only as a tool to attack systems, starting with knapsack systems in the early 80\u2019s. Lattices can also be used to break conventional public-key cryptosystems such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman when they are incorrectly implemented. This talk will explain these fun attacks in concrete terms, with code you can run at home.\n\nAlgorithms will be presented as Python/Sage code snippets and will already be online before the talk at https://latticehacks.cr.yp.to.\n\nThis is a joint presentation by Daniel J.

We will describe who initiated the investigation against \u201eJugend Rettet\u201c and show how fascists, secret service and police worked hand in hand to stop the \u201eIuventa\u201c from saving people from drowning.\n\nThe seizure of the \u201eIuventa\u201c was neither the begin nor the end of a\nsmear campaign to discredit the work done by the civil search and rescue fleet. It was a small part in much bigger game played by the european union to discredit the work of the NGOs working in the mediterranean. In our talk we will explain why there is such a big interest by the European states to hinder their work and how the European Union is actually breaking international law to do so.\n\nStarting with a Frontex strategy paper from January 2016 we will describe how the European Union tries to externalize their borders onto the African continent. To places where there are no cameras or eye witnesses to show the European public the deadliness of their borders.\n\nFinally we\u2019d like to discuss what is still possible despite the growing pressure by the european states. How can we fight fortress Europe? How do we defend us against the accusations? What have we reached? What can we still reach?\n\nKathrin has been operating in search & rescue projects in the Aegean and Mediterranean for the last 21 months, since August 2016 she is supporting Jugend Rettet as Field Coordinator, RHIB driver and Head of Mission. 2017 she trained and briefed all crews that operated on the Iuventa and joined a number of missions off the Libyan coast - including the last one in which the ship was seized.\n\nShe was confronted not only with the fact that Jugend Rettet had been subject to surveillance by Italian authorities over months but also with the confiscation of her personal belongings including laptop and cell phones.

        "title": "Spy vs. Spy: A Modern Study Of Microphone Bugs Operation And Detection",
        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "In 2015, artist Ai Weiwei was bugged in his home, presumably by government actors. This situation raised our awareness on the lack of research in our community about operating and detecting spying microphones. Our biggest concern was that most of the knowledge came from fictional movies. Therefore, we performed a deep study on the state-of-the-art of microphone bugs, their characteristics, features and pitfalls. It included real life experiments trying to bug ourselves and trying to detect the hidden mics. Given the lack of open detection tools, we developed a free software SDR-based program, called Salamandra, to detect and locate hidden microphones in a room. After more than 120 experiments we concluded that placing mics correctly and listening is not an easy task, but it has a huge payoff when it works. Also, most mics can be detected easily with the correct tools (with some exceptions on GSM mics). In our experiments the average time to locate the mics in a room was 15 minutes. Locating mics is the novel feature of Salamandra, which is released to the public with this work. We hope that our study raises awareness on the possibility of being bugged by a powerful actor and the countermeasure tools available for our protection.",
        "description": "Most of what the general public knows about microphones bugs comes from movies and other fictional sources, which usually is far from real. An example of these inaccuracies is the public speculation made by the Counselor of the United States President, Kellyanne Conway, who expressed that a microwave oven can spy as a camera; the answer is NO, as refuted in article by WIRED. The current literature about microphones bugs is disturbingly scarce, leaving most people to believe the myths distributed by the media. One of the goals of this work is to debunk the fictional beliefs around mics bugs by performing a thorough study and real life experiments with them.\nThis paper is divided into three phases. First, we perform a survey of the state-of-the-art of mic bugs and their characteristics. Second, we develop our own free software detection tool, called Salamandra. Third, we perform several real life experiments on placing and detecting bugs to examine how difficult it was. Finally, we conclude with a thorough analysis of our experience.\nThe first phase makes a deep survey of all the civilian-accessible microphone bugs. It takes into account physical characteristics, frequencies, transmission modes, battery options, operational lifetime, operational listening distance, easiness of listening by the operator, advantages & disadvantages, configurations if any, and easiness of detection by various means. The end goal of the first phase is to show the difficulty in using microphone bugs.\nThe second phase presents our free software, SDR-based tool to detect hidden microphones called Salamandra. Although a professional microphone search usually requires more complex hardware, we show that a simple SDR USB device and our tool can be used to detect the mic bugs accurately. Moreover, Salamandra has a novel location feature to find mics quickly; a feature that is not available in most commercial detectors. The two most important limitations of the hardware detection solutions are their false detection of mics and their false positive detections of ghost mics.\nSalamandra uses several novel techniques to detect mics by taking advantage of its execution in a computer, including continuous discovery and location of mics.\nThe third phase consists in a group of offensive/defensive experiments on placing and detecting bugs in real life. While one of the researchers places the mics and tries to listen to meaningful spoken passwords, the other runs Salamandra to try to know if there was a mic and where. These real life experiments shone light about the difficulty of placing mics and how easy is to find them.\nAs far as we know this work is one of the few on the topic of analyzing the real performance of placing and detecting spying microphones. The main contributions of this paper are:\n\u2022 As far as we know, the first scientific research on the topic of real life spy microphones.\n\u2022 A novel free software SDR-based detection tool to locate microphone bugs, called Salamandra. A tool trained with real experiments.\n\u2022 The first comparison of mic bugs characteristics, ranges and performance, based on field experiments in real life scenarios.\n\u2022 The first experiments of real-life placing and detection of mics to analyze their performance, quality and time to detection.\n\u2022 The first analysis of spy mics audio quality and improvement.",

So far, IoT is more a wide range of disaster plots with a lot of security and privacy concerns that are a danger for the internet rather than they are the world-saving development the tech guys predict. One example: connected (sex) toys. Some countries already banned them or are planning to ban them. Another example are digital home assistants that tend to change our sense of privacy. \n\nBut what can we do? We can\u2019t stop the development, but we can make products safer. In my talk I am going to present current examples where IoT fails in terms of privacy, security and use case. Rather than going into technical detail of \u201eHow did that hack work out?\u201c I want to concentrate on the ethical and practical problems that arise out of connecting everything. I also want to focus on how consumers can influence the market and what we all can do as a society. \n\nFor example: Currently manufacturers take care primarily of their business to bring the products quickly to the market, and less to the safety of it. In my talk, I would like to show some examples and explain why this becomes the problem for all of us - and what regulators plan to stop that. As customers we are also not doomed, we can help to stop this internet of fails. ",

These well-planned systemic efforts escalated with the Hong Kong police targeting the Snowden Refugees, instead of providing protection to them.\nThe Hong Kong government has been aggressively seeking to rapidly remove Vanessa and her stateless daughter to the Philippines under conditions of a nation-wide state of emergency, martial law in Mindanao and a recently catalyzed nation-wide civil war with the National People\u2019s Army. In the name of a war on drugs, President Duterte directed the well-planned and systematic use of torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings of tens of thousands of innocent civilians including politicians, with no end in sight. His actions amount to crimes against humanity.\nThe Hong Kong government also seeks to deport the Sri Lankan Snowden Refugees to a country accused of having committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, with its current Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe accused of being complicit in war crimes and crimes against humanity. Today Sri Lanka is plagued by systemic use of torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings with no end in sight. \nIn the above context, the Hong Kong government has failed to protect the Snowden Refugees and in fact have taken steps to put them in harms\u2019 way both in Hong Kong and their countries of origin.",

        "abstract": "Systems that hide their firmware-- often deep in readout-protected flash or hidden in encrypted ROM chips-- have long stymied reverse engineers, who often have to resort to inventive methods to understand closed systems. To help reduce the effort needed to get a foothold into a new system, we present GlitchKit-- an open source hardware and firmware solution that significantly simplifies the process of fault-injecting your way into a new system -- and of fault-injecting firmware secrets out! This talk presents the development completed thus far, demonstrates the use of GlitchKit in simple attacks, and invites participation in the development of our open-source tools.",
        "description": "Work by a variety of authors has demonstrated the vulnerability of hardware peripherals to fault-injection-driven firmware-disclosure attacks [1]-- or in other words: glitching attacks that cause devices to 'accidentally' disclose their own firmware. A common form of this attack exploits the behavior of hardware peripherals as they send out bits of read-only memory-- by inducing a glitch at the end of a communication, transmitters can often be inticed to transmit memory beyond the end of the scheduled communcation, often leaking firmware and other device secrets.\n\nFor glitching attacks to function properly, glitches must be precisely timed relative to communication events-- a requirement that often requires reverse engineers to develop purpose-built glitch-triggering hardware. GitchKit helps to relieve this burden-- providing an easy, context-aware glitching toolkit that can synchronize glitch events to a variety of communications events, including events generated by common protocols such as USB. GlitchKit builds atop existing open-source software and hardware-- including the GreatFET communications multitool, the FaceDancer USB-hacking toolkit, and the ChipWhisperer fault-injection toolkit-- and provides an entirely-open-source stack for easy glitching-- hopefully making it easier for you to get your hands on that elusive piece of firmware!\n\nThis talk presents the theory behind firmware-disclosure glitching, and aims to help every hacker start using open-source tools to start opening up closed systems. Accordingly, we discuss the current state of the GlitchKit project, describe in detail how it can be used to 'break open' existing closed systems, and provide live demonstration of GlitchKit features.\n\n[1] e.g, http://scanlime.org/2016/10/scanlime015-glitchy-descriptor-firmware-grab/",

Regarding the high integration of sensors and digital systems to control power-grids, telecom networks and automation infrastructures (e.g. Smart-grids, Industrial Control Systems), the intrinsic vulnerability of electronic devices to electromagnetic interference is of fundamental interest. In the context of IT Security, few studies have been carried out to understand how the effects may be a significant issue especially in the far-field region (distance between the transmitter\u2019s antenna and the target with regard to the wavelength/central frequency). Most studies in Emanation Security (EMSEC) are related to near-field probing for side-channel and fault injection attacks assuming a close physical access to the targeted devices. In this paper, we propose a methodology to detect, classify and correlate the effect induced during the intentional exposure of analogue and digital systems to electromagnetic interference. Applying this methodology, the implication of the effects for the IT security world will be discussed with regards to the attacker profile needed to set-up a given scenario. ",

        "abstract": "Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is fundamentally broken on modern hardware due to a side-channel attack on the Memory management unit, allowing memory addresses to be leaked from JavaScript.  This talk will show how.",
        "description": "Address space layout randomization (ASLR) has often been sold as an\nimportant first line of defense against memory corruption attacks\nand a building block for many modern countermeasures. Existing\nattacks against ASLR rely on software vulnerabilities and/or on\nrepeated (and detectable) memory probing.\n\nIn this talk, we show that neither is a hard requirement\nand that ASLR is fundamentally insecure on modern cache-\nbased architectures, making ASLR and caching conflicting\nrequirements (ASLR xor Cache, or simply AnC). To support\nthis claim, we describe a new EVICT+TIME cache attack\non the virtual address translation performed by the memory\nmanagement unit (MMU) of modern processors. Our AnC attack\nrelies on the property that the MMU's page-table walks result\nin caching page-table pages in the shared last-level cache (LLC).\n\nAs a result, an attacker can derandomize virtual addresses of a\nvictim's code and data by locating the cache lines that store the\npage-table entries used for address translation.\nRelying only on basic memory accesses allows AnC to be\nimplemented in JavaScript without any specific instructions or\nsoftware features. We show our JavaScript implementation can\nbreak code and heap ASLR in two major browsers running on\nthe latest Linux operating system with 28 bits of entropy in 150\nseconds. We further verify that the AnC attack is applicable to\nevery modern architecture that we tried, including Intel, ARM\nand AMD. Mitigating this attack without naively disabling caches\nis hard, since it targets the low-level operations of the MMU.\nWe conclude that ASLR is fundamentally flawed in sandboxed\nenvironments such as JavaScript and future defenses should not\nrely on randomized virtual addresses as a building block.\n",

The radio signal is AES-128 encrypted and the system is marketed to be \u201cas secure as online banking\u201d. In comparison to conventional and often trivial to break wireless access control systems, the system should thus make it practically infeasible to clone a genuine transmitter so that attackers can get unauthorized access. We used the low-cost CCC rad1o software defined radio (SDR) platform to intercept and analyze the wireless radio signal. We took apart several Hoermann BiSecur hand transmitters and subsequently utilized a vulnerability in the microcontroller to successfully extract the firmware. In order to conduct a security audit, the extracted firmware was disassembled and analyzed so that the encryption mechanism, the key material, the cryptographic operations as well as the RF interface could be reverse engineered. Our security analysis shows that the overall security design is sound, but the manufacturer failed to properly initialize the random seed of the transmitters. As a result, an attacker can intercept an arbitrary radio frame and trivially compute the utilized encryption key within less than a second. Once the key is known to the attacker, a genuine transmitter can be cloned with an SDR platform such as the CCC rad1o. In addition to unauthorized operation of gates and doors, there is a likely (although currently untested) impact on Smart Home appliances that use the BiSecur system. We tested a total of 7 hand transmitters from 3 different model series and with manufacturing dates between 2015 and 2017. All analyzed hand transmitters shared the same static random seed and were found to be vulnerable to our attack. The vulnerability can easily be fixed so that future hand transmitters and radio transmission are protected from our attack.",

        "abstract": "In German nursing science the dominant position on emergent technologies demands the removal of machines from caring environments (\u201eEntmaschinisierung\u201c). In contrast to this, European research policy heavily focus on developing new health and social technologies to solve societal issues like a skill shortage in nursing. Thinking about technology in nursing science cannot but be conflicted. In this talk we first expose requirements for particularly conceptualizing the application of technological systems in care work settings. Further we will give an overview on main arguments against digital technologies in care with an example of a current research project in the field of Augmented Reality in care work. ",
        "description": "In the first part of this talk we will introduce current positions of German nursing science and German nurses on emergent technologies. For German nursing scientists the main element of nursing is the relationship between the patient and their nurse. One central aspect of this relationship is communication. Corporal [\u201cLeib\u201d] perception is stressed as well as implicit or tacit knowledge. Nursing experts are presumed to use these kinds of knowledge to guide their action. It is argued that digitalization stands in the way of using these kinds of non-discursive knowledge, as digital technology is only able to display discursive knowledge. Thus, care logic and logic of technology are described as incommensurable. \nNevertheless, usage of electronic health records is increasing. Furthermore, a wide range of prototypes are developed as they are conceived as solutions regarding existing problems at least from certain points of view. E.g. Smart Devices can be used to support blood sampling or the documentation process. We will show you a prototype which is part of our research project, to offer you the possibility to get your own ideas of advantages and disadvantages.\nIn the second part of this talk the theoretical premises of main arguments against technology will be revealed and a counterperspective will be introduced. The progress of biotechnologies in some way stimulates a slowly growing mutual interest of the humanities and natural sciences. Notwithstanding in nursing science there is still a hostile attitude against if not a categorical denial of technologies ranging from robotic systems to smart home technologies and even the PC. Emergent technologies are mistakenly seen as strongly (and only) bound to medicine and hence being hopelessly fought. On closer consideration it becomes obvious that the theoretical premises of this perspective are deeply linked to the idea of human exceptionalism. In their (neo-) humanistic vindication nursing scientists seek to set themselves free from the influence of medicine as a dominant discipline. ",

        "description": "This talk is not only about security, but about hacking and video games. Many video games are about driving cars, whether it is for racing, or heisting and escaping the police. In this talk, we will explain how the user experience could actually be improved by connecting a car to a video game and turning it into a game controller.\n\nWe will discuss about these connected systems, how car components interact with one another, the different protocols, or anything that came to us during this journey.\n\nHowever there was one important constraint during all that experience: no car could be dismantled nor modified. The main goal of this analysis was to try doing something out of the data which could be freely recovered while plugging itself to the OBD-II port of a car. As mentioned, this resulted in the possibility of controlling a video game car through the real car, like a simulator, without the need of modifying anything in the car itself.\n\nUnfortunately, this requires a lot of gasoline to have the engine powered on and run. Moreover, gasoline is really expensive in France. So we looked for a way to reduce that cost. We actually found a nice device on the Internet to optimize the amount of gasoline used by the engine. Apparently, it works by connecting to the OBD-II port and reconfigures the engine\u2019s ECU. We looked into that to understand what was actually going on\u2026 and try to reduce the cost of the drifting.\n\nThe following points will be mentioned during the presentation:\nECUs\nCAN bus\nOBD-II (DTCs/PIDs)\nOn-top-of-CAN protocols\nUDS (Diagnostic/Security session)\nReverse engineering: the meanings of CAN messages\nUsing a real car as a simulator, for poories\nMinor details about how to create a custom game controller\nOBD dongle reverse engineering",

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "Eliminating nuclear weapons will require trusted measurement systems to confirm authenticity of nuclear warheads prior to their dismantlement. A new idea for such an inspection system is to use vintage hardware (Apple IIe/6502) instead of modern microprocessors, reducing the attack surface through simplicity. In the talk, we present and demo a custom open hardware measurement system based on gamma spectroscopy.",
        "description": "Twenty-five years after the end of the Cold War, there are still about 15,000 nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the nine nuclear weapon states. After an era of transparency, cooperation, and confidence-building in the 1990s, progress in nuclear arms control has slowed down in the 2000s and is currently in a crisis. The newly negotiated Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (\u201cBan Treaty\u201d) and the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize have given new attention to the enduring threat posed by these weapons and the urgency of further reductions. Any further progress toward nuclear disarmament will have to rely on robust verification mechanisms, especially while there is limited trust among relevant states. This requires trusted measurement systems to confirm the authenticity of nuclear warheads based on their radiation signatures. These signatures are considered sensitive information, the systems have to be designed to protect them. To accomplish this task, so-called \u201cinformation barriers\u201d have been proposed. These devices process the sensitive information acquired during an inspection, but only display results in a pass/fail manner. Traditional inspection systems rely on complex electronics both for data acquisition and processing. Several research efforts have produced prototype systems following fundamentally different design philosophies, but it has proven difficult to demonstrate that hidden switches and side channels do not exist. After almost 30 years of research and development, no viable and widely accepted system has emerged.\n\nWe pursue a fundamentally different approach: Our prototype of an inspection system uses vintage hardware built around a 6502 processor. The processor uses 8-micron technology (about 600 times larger than current 14-nanometer technology) and has only about 3500 transistors. Vintage hardware may have a number of important advantages for applications where two parties need to simultaneously establish trust in the hardware used. CPUs designed in the distant past, at a time when their use for sensitive measurements was never envisioned, drastically reduce concerns that the other party implemented backdoors or hidden switches on the hardware level. Today, the design of the 6502 is de-facto open source, and several projects have explored the hardware in great detail (visual6502.org, monster6502.com). The technology is so basic that it would be difficult or impossible to surreptitiously implement extra functionalities that could be used to leak secret information. For the same reason, however, using vintage hardware also comes at a price, as the performance of the inspection system is limited, and data acquisition and processing has to be designed and highly optimized accordingly. \n\nIn this talk, we demonstrate the performance of the inspection system in an actual inspection setting. For this purpose, we built a prototype system using an Apple IIe and a custom-made open-source data-processing board connected to a sodium-iodide radiation detector for low-resolution gamma spectroscopy. Data processing and analysis is exclusively done on the Apple IIe hardware. In inspection mode, the Apple IIe is used as an information barrier, and the result of the analysis is simply displayed by a green/red (pass/fail) LED on the data-processing board. To wrap up, we discuss the broader context required for verifying deeper cuts in the nuclear arsenals and demonstrate the system as part of a notional inspection scenario, including its capability to detect basic cheating scenarios, in which a dishonest party presents an invalid item that has a different radiation signature.\n",

The discussion will include examples of countries that can require you to enter passwords to decrypt data on your laptop and will examine your social media and cloud data, and provide advice on which countries may require more extensive precautions. This includes the challenges of entering the United States in the time of Trump, discussing the recent changes to policy for visitors entering the country, what your rights are as a visa holder, and details about EFF\u2019s lawsuit to challenge the policy.\n\nTurning to the practical, the talk will discuss techniques to help protect your data, from basic precautions like backups and externally stored data, to more advanced advice about encryption and password strategies, secure boot processes, as well as data hygiene - how to travel clean, and still have access to important information on the other side. This will cover what border agents are theoretically capable of doing to compromise devices, and what precautions you can take to secure your data before this interaction occurs. The discussion will include advice about laptops, mobile phones, flash drives, digital cameras, and other common digital data devices.  While critical, technological protections are not enough, so we will also discuss the practicalities of interacting with border agents.\n\nFinally, we will discuss what people can do to keep themselves informed, and stay active in the fight for a better future.",

This is done by first investigating what would be good places where the bugs might be. Once determined, a detailed review is performed of these places. Samples and demos will be shown. \n\nI end the presentation with some results and conclusions. I will list what the outcome was in terms of bugs found, and who \u2013 based on the data I now have \u2013 among the three main BSD distributions can be seen as the clear winner and loser.

From there we are comparing the differences between a chip (ICC) and a contactless (NFC) transaction.\n\nAfterwards we are ready to look at Apple Pay, Android Pay and other card emulations. Even though they provide the same features on first look, they work fundamentally different on the technical level. We will learn about storing sensitive transaction information offline on the device in a Secure Element (SE) or online with your service provider utilizing Hosted Card Emulation (HCE).\n\nIn the end, we will take a short look at how contactless payments might influence our future, why legacy is still king and if tokenization might just save your day one time.",

        "description": "The increasing demand on energy seems to be one of the greatest challenges for modern society. [1,2] Power generation approaches of the 20th century, such as coal, oil, or nuclear plants come with certain issues limiting the scalability and/or questioning even the approach itself since they may harm nature and environment on a longterm time scale. \nRenewable energy generated e.g. with solar cells, wind mills, or tidal stations are on the rise but they usually depend to certain locations, weather, storage capabilities, and in some cases even on political climates. [3]\nSpace based Solar Power generation [4,5] overcomes some of these issues: solar cells in orbit are independent of atmospheric influences and weather (e.g. clouds), solar harvesting satellites can be placed in orbit so they always face sun and generate power continuously, and there is enough space to scale the plants in order to serve the power demands. Solar power is an infinite power source (at least in the time scale for humanity) \nThe bottle neck with this approach, however, is the transfer of the power from orbit to Earth. But if solved, this technology can supply power to locations on Earth, that are remotely located, that lack other power generation capabilities (e.g. due to a natural catastrophe), or that come with varying demands on power consumption. \nSome questions still remain: Is it possible to transfer power wireless over such a long distance with a sufficient efficiency? [6-8] How would that influence life on Earth?

In this talk, we will present what we think will disrupt energy production. We're not talking about retrofitting the power grid with yet some more insecure 'smart' component. This is about predictably available renewable energy called Airborne Wind Energy (AWE): autonomous flying drones at high altitudes can harvest the wind\u2019s energy cheaper than any wind turbine, and most importantly: it can be done almost everywhere and almost all the time, solving the two major technological and geopolitical challenges of sustainable energy production, which has rattled the world for decades. We are convinced that humans should power the world by clean energy only, and we think AWE can be a key element to do just that. In this talk, we will cover the physical foundations, introduce a few of the control algorithms and the challenges associated with very strong forces acting on very light objects. We will also shed a light on the progress of leaders in the field such as Ampyx Power and Google Makani.\n \nBut there is more to it: Using the `AWEsome' project, we will show you how to build an open source wind drone for yourself by hacking a model plane and its autopilot based on the open and free Ardupilot framework. While its energy production will be rather limited, it serves a lot of useful purposes: For example, it paves the way to test crazy new ideas of start, landing and flight modes on a cheap disposable platform and is a training playground for flight operations.\n\nMaybe by the time of the next Chaos Communication Camp, you will have joined us and we can fly our wind energy harvesting robots together -- and save the world, all at the same time.",

To connect with the environment, for instance, do we need to connect with how it feels? This talk draws on works exploring both the marine environment and food, using knowledge from science, art, culture, instinct and history to create happenings and instances that break out the border of \"me\" and \"my environment\" to create an empathic response linking what we traditionally consider to be inside and outside. This will be demonstrated in the context of two artistic works - The Coral Empathy Device and Vital | Flows.",
        "description": "We exist within a set of rules about the value of knowledge - a hierarchy of knowledge that places quantified data at the top and the \u201clower\u201d senses at the bottom. The neglect of other forms of knowledge \u2013 aesthetic, embodied, cultural and more \u2013 has created a void in our socio-political and environmental relations that has been filled by emotive, populist rhetoric that undermines the validity of the knowledge we have. Post-truth practices are answering a gap that arises from our reliance on cognitive knowledge as the main valid form of knowledge \u2013 including datafication of everything \u2013 particularly in politics. \n\nAs an alternative I propose we augment this cognitive and data derived knowledge with more emotionally connecting knowledges, to achieve a more integrated understanding of the world, and to once again embark on a quest for a type of truth. \n\n\nWhen we live close to the land we experience empathy with the land. It has recently been said that indeed our present mode of life has led to the \u201cdeath of empathy\u201d. The Coral Empathy Device uses principles of embodied learning to explore whether physical sensation curated by an artist can evoke interspecies empathy in a human for a coral \u2013 a creature at once so similar and so alien to us. The artwork creates a discomforting experience that challenges the visitor\u2019s embodied experience to leverage the fact that \u201cthe body schema is the converting system of perception and action\u201d. By bridging the gap between the way we perceive and the way coral perceives, can we connect with the marine environment in a new way? Can we foster action by creating knowledge of another species within the body as a whole? \n\nVital | Flows is an ongoing work drawing knowledge about food from multiple sources - DIY science, phenomenology, instinct, culture - to explore the ephemeral nature of boundaries between self and other. This paper will report the results of open sourcing these methods, working with London communities who will use them to explore food and its meaning. This open source artistic research methodology for exploring environmental topics creates a platform for rhyzomic growth of selfactualised research that brings together and brings the best out of online and offline knowledge sharing. This is an exploration in breaking down the boundaries between inside and outside \"myself\", redefining the concept of the individual to incorporate the reality of our permeability. By achieving this through melding knowledge from quantification, embodiment, aesthetics and more, can we reach a new understanding of the place of self and other?",

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "The representation of thunderstorms (deep convection) and rain showers in climate models represents a major challenge, as this process is usually approximated with semi-empirical parameterizations due to the lack of appropriate computational resolution. Climate simulations using kilometer-scale horizontal resolution allow explicitly resolving deep convection and thus allow for an improved representation of the water cycle. We present a set of such simulations covering Europe and global computational domains. Finally, we discuss challenges and prospects climate modelers face on heterogeneous supercomputers architectures.",
        "description": "Today the evidence for global climate change is unequivocal, and the human influence is clear. Therefore the focus of young researchers has shifted from assessing whether the Planet is warming towards envisioning how a warmer world might look like. For instance, basic physical principles suggest that the hydrological cycle of Planet Earth will likely undergo dramatic changes. However, understanding and describing the involved processes, estimating future changes, and assessing the underlying uncertainties has proven to be difficult and complex. In this effort, numerical simulations of the weather and climate system are a useful research tool.\nWeather and climate modeling involves solving the governing equations of atmospheric motion on a numerical mesh and employing semi-empirical parameterizations that treat the processes not represented explicitly. For example, the parameterizations typically include treatments for thunderstorms and rain showers (deep convection). These processes are fundamental to the climate system since they vertically redistribute moisture, heat, and momentum, but so far they could not be resolved explicitly, due to the coarse gird spacing of the mesh (resolution) employed in the current generation of climate models. \nIn the recent year's power constrains in the domain of supercomputing have lead to heterogeneous node designs mixing conventional multi-core processors and accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPU\u2019s). These machines posses properties beneficial for weather and climate codes and hence allow refining the resolution of the involved computational mesh to the kilometer scale. Convective clouds can then be represented explicitly (convection-resolving) and the models can be formulated much closer to physical first principles. However, to exploit the capabilities of these supercomputers, model codes have to be ported, a challenging task the weather and climate modeling community is struggling with.\n\nWe discuss prospects and challenges climate modelers face on these new supercomputers and highlight the potential for addressing key open science questions. The presentation is illustrated with simulations recently accomplished using a new version of the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling weather and climate model (COSMO), capable of exploiting these heterogeneous supercomputer architectures. Using results form a then-year-long climate simulation on a computational domain covering Europe (1536x1536x60 grid points) we highlight some of the added value of the approach regarding the representation of precipitation processes. Furthermore, we explore the gap between the currently established regional simulations and global simulations by scaling the GPU accelerated version of the COSMO model to a near-global computational domain.\nReferences:\nFuhrer, O., Chadha, T., Hoefler, T., Kwasniewski, G., Lapillonne, X., Leutwyler, D., L\u00fcthi, D., Osuna, C., Sch\u00e4r, C., Schulthess, T.

Instead, we need a new paradigm in Earth System science that is founded equally on a deep understanding of the physical and biological Earth System \u2013 and of the economic, technological, social and cultural forces that are now an intrinsic part of it.

        "abstract": "The NERF and Heads projects bring Linux back to the cloud servers' boot ROMs by replacing nearly all of the vendor firmware with a reproducible built Linux runtime that acts as a fast, flexible, and measured boot loader.  It has been years since any modern servers have supported Free Firmware options like LinuxBIOS or coreboot, and as a result server and cloud security has been dependent on unreviewable, closed source, proprietary vendor firmware of questionable quality.  With Heads on NERF, we are making it possible to take back control of our systems with Open Source Software from very early in the boot process, helping build a more trustworthy and secure cloud.",
        "description": "The NERF project was started by Ron Minnich (author of LinuxBIOS and lead of coreboot at Google) in January 2017 with the goal to bring Linux back to the BIOS by retaining a minimal set of PEI modules for memory controller initialization and replacing the entirety of the server vendor's UEFI DXE firmware with a reproducibly built Linux runtime.  It has been ported to a few different manufacturer's servers, demonstrating the general portability of the concept.\n\nNERF is fast - less than twenty second boot times, versus multiple minutes.  It's flexible - it can make use of any devices, filesystems and protocols that Linux supports. And it's open - users can easily customize the boot scripts, fix issues, build their own runtimes and reflash their firmware with their own keys.\n\nThe Heads runtime was started by Trammell Hudson (author of Thunderstrike and Magic Lantern) and was presented last year at 33c3.  It is a slightly more secure bootloader that uses Linux, the TPM, GPG and kexec to be able to load, measure, verify and execute the real kernel.  As part of porting Heads to work with NERF on server platforms, it now includes tools like Keylime to allow severs to remotely attest to user controlled systems that the NERF/Heads firmware matches what they expect, as well as network and iSCSI drivers for diskless compute node servers.\n\nIn this talk we'll provide an overview of the NERF project, the currently supported server mainboards, and the continued development on the Heads runtime that allows more trust in the servers that make up the cloud.",

It is a form of biotechnical civil disobedience, seeking to subvert dominant biopolitical agents of hormonal management, knowledge production, and anthropogenic toxicity. The project begins with a speculative question: what if it was possible to make estrogen in the kitchen? From this seed arises more fundamental questions about who is producing hormones, whose bodies are affected, and how environmental hormones exist already as a state of toxicity. While issues of body and gender sovereignty are deeply at stake, endocrine disruptors termed \u2018xenoestrogens\u2019 pervade our environments due to petrochemical agro-industrial and pharmaceutical forces. These xeno-molecules change the morphology of our bodies and bodies of non-human species, evidencing a malleability inherent to nature but alien to our prescribed notions of (eco)heteronormalcy. In response to the \u201cmolecular queering\u201d performed by estrogen, facilitated by dominant hegemonic forces, the project initiates a public dialogue through DIY/DIWO (do-it-yourself/do-it-with-others) biohacking and artistic intervention.

There is also the srsLTE project, which provides open source implementation of LTE base station (eNodeB) and moreover the client side stack (srsUE) for SDR.

The problem is that the SDR platforms were out of the hardware the project could work on. The primary supported hardware for now are old Calypso based phones (mostly Motorola C1XX).\n\nDespite they are designed to act as mobile phone, there are still some limitations, such as the usage of proprietary firmware for DSP (Digital Signal Processor), which is being managed by the OsmocomBB software, and lack of GPRS support. Moreover, these phones are not manufactured anymore, so it's not so easy to find them nowadays.\n\nTaking the known problems and limitations into account, and having a strong desire to give everyone the new possibilities for research and education in the telecommunications scope, we decided to write a 'bridge' between OsmocomBB and SDR. Using GNU Radio, a well known environment for signal processing, we have managed to get some interesting results, which we would like to share with community on the upcoming CCC.",

        "abstract": "In 2017, the federal states of Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria suggested the extension of the law on the analysis of forensic DNA. Up to now, DNA fingerprinting  in forensic settings may, in addition to non-coding features of DNA, only analyze the chromosomal sex of the person, but not any other openly visible feature. Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg, under the leadership of CSU and the Green party, are pushing forward to analyze DNA found at crime scenes regarding hair color, eye color, skin color and in the case of Bavaria even geographical ethnicity. Extended DNA analysis, or \u201cDNA facial composite\u201d  is seen as an impartial witness to the crime and, in the eyes of the states\u2019 government, would help solve crimes. But would it?",
        "description": "Ever since TV shows such as CSI or NCIS have become popular, DNA evidence has gained a reputation for an infallible method of crime solving. However, similar to fingerprints, DNA evidence up to now only serves as a method of matching the DNA at a crime scene to a suspect. So what if there are no suspects? In theory, DNA possesses all the information on what a human being would look like. Does that mean we could construct a facial composite from blood spots, semen or saliva? While the term \u201cDNA facial composite\u201d may imply so, the science of it is still in its infancy. We can determine a likely eye, hair and skin color and a geographic ethnicity from the DNA. In some cases even more features. This could, depending on the case, lead investigations to the right suspect - but down a very dangerous path. \nGenetic information is subject to the laws of privacy. For one, instead of having a crime and finding as suspect, extended DNA analysis leads to an investigation into a crime, where there is no suspect, but a range of \u201cnon-suspect persons of interest\u201d that are connected to the case only by their appearance. The presumption of innocence is vital to a democracy. Putting people of similar appearance \u2013 or even ethnical groups \u2013 into the focus of investigation, is likely to spark even more xenophobic movements in Germany.  Information on skin color correlates with medical information such as skin cancer risk, but also risk for heart disease. This medical information is especially protected by law. What is worse, the technology could lead investigations to the wrong \u201cnon-suspect person of interest\u201d. Just as hair color may change with age, so may for instance the appearance of a person\u2019s gender. Not all genetic information is directly seen in the phenotype. Adding up to this, the data correlating genes to geographic ethnicity is only as good as the data of people who have contributed to the database in the first place.\nIf DNA analysis is to be implemented in Germany \u2013 and it very well might be \u2013 we need to push for hard data protection laws and strict rules when and where it may be applied. \n",

From a physicist's perspective, wireless radiation is just light, more precisely: coherent electromagnetic radiation. It is virtually the same as the beam of a laser, except that its wavelength is much longer (cm vs \u00b5m). \n\nWe have developed a way to visualize this radiation, providing a view of the world as it would look like if our eyes could see wireless radiation. \n\nOur scheme is based on holography, a technique to record three-dimensional pictures by a phase-coherent recording of radiation in a two-dimensional plane. This technique is traditionally implemented using laser light. We have adapted it to work with wireless radiation, and recorded holograms of building interiors illuminated by the omnipresent stray field of wireless devices. In the resulting three-dimensional images we can see both emitters (appearing as bright spots) and absorbing objects (appearing as shadows in the beam). Our scheme does not require any knowledge of the data transmitted and works with arbitrary signals, including encrypted communication. \n\nThis result has several implications: it could provide a way to track wireless emitters in buildings, it could provide a new way for through-wall imaging of building infrastructure like water and power lines. As these applications are available even with encrypted communication, it opens up new questions about privacy.\n\n\n",

In contrast, activities like testing, debugging, and code review are accepted as essential.  They are woven into the lives of nearly all developers.  In this talk, I will explain how I see machine-checked proofs enabling new everyday activities for developers of computer software and hardware.  These activities have the potential to lower development effort dramatically, at the same time as they increase our assurance that systems behave correctly and securely.  I will give a cosmological overview of this field, answering the FAQs that seem to stand in the way of practicality; and I will illustrate the principles with examples from projects that you can clone from GitHub today, covering the computing stack from digital hardware design to cryptographic software and applications.",
        "description": "<p>Today's developers of computer software and hardware are tremendously effective, compared to their predecessors.  We have found very effective ways of <b>modularizing</b> and <b>validating</b> our work.  The talk is about ammunition for these activities from a perhaps-unexpected source.</p>\n\n<p><b>Modularity</b> involves breaking a complex system into a hierarchy of simpler pieces, which may be written and understood separately.  Structured programming (e.g., using loops and conditionals instead of <tt>goto</tt>s) helps us read and understand parts of a single function in isolation, and data abstraction lets us encapsulate important functionality in objects, with guarantees that other code can only access the private data by calling public methods.  That way, we can convince ourselves that the encapsulated code upholds certain essential properties, <i>regardless of which other code it is linked with</i>.  Systematic unit testing also helps enforce contracts for units of modularity.  Each of these techniques can be rerun automatically, to catch regressions in evolving systems, and catch those regressions in a way that accurately points the finger of responsibility to particular modules.</p>\n\n<p><b>Validation</b> is an important part of development that encompasses testing, debugging, code review, and anything else that we do to raise our confidence that the system behaves as intended.  Experienced engineers know that validation tends to take up the majority of engineering effort.  Often that effort involves mentally taxing activities that would not otherwise come up in coding.  One example is thinking about test-case coverage, and another is including instrumentation that produces traces to consult during debugging.</p>\n\n<p>It is not hard for working developers to imagine great productivity gains from better ways to break systems into pieces or raise our confidence in those pieces.  The claim I will make in this talk is that a key source of such insights has been neglected: <b>machine-checked mathematical proofs</b>.  Here the basic functionality is an ASCII language for defining mathematical objects, stating theorems about them, and giving proofs of theorems.  Crucially, an algorithm checks that purported proofs really do establish the theorems.  By going about these activities in the style of programming, we inherit usual supporting tools like IDEs, version control, continuous integration, and automated build processes.  But how could so esoteric a task as math proofs call for that kind of tooling, and what does it have to do with building real computer systems?</p>\n\n<p>I will explain a shared vision to that end, developed along with many other members of my research community.  Let me try to convince you that all of the following goals are attainable in the next 10 years.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>We will have complete computer systems implementing moderately complex network servers for popular protocols, <i>proved to implement those protocols correctly, from the level of digital circuits on up</i>.  We will remove all deployed code (hardware or software) from the trusted computing base, shifting our trust to much smaller specifications and proof checkers.</li>\n  <li>Hobbyists will be able to design new embedded computing platforms by mixing and matching open-source hardware and software components, also mixing and matching <i>the proofs</i> of these components, <i>guaranteeing no bugs at the digital-abstraction level or higher</i>, with <i>no need for debugging</i>.</li>\n  <li>New styles of library design will be enabled by the chance to attach a <i>formal behavioral specification</i> to each library.  For instance, rank-and-file programmers will able to assemble their own code for cryptographic protocols, with code that looks like reference implementations in Python, but <i>getting performance comparable to what experts handcraft in assembly today</i>.  Yet that benefit would come with <i>no need to trust that library authors have avoided bugs or intentional backdoors</i>, perhaps even including <i>automatic proofs of cryptographic security properties</i>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Main technical topics to cover to explain my optimism:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The basic functionality of <i>proof assistants</i> and why we should trust their conclusions</li>\n  <li>How to think about system decomposition with specifications and proofs, including why, for most components, we do not need to worry about specification mistakes</li>\n  <li>The different modes of applying proof technology to check or generate components</li>\n  <li>The engineering techniques behind cost-effective proof authoring for realistic systems</li>\n  <li>A hardware case study: <a href=\"https://github.com/mit-plv/kami\">Kami</a>, supporting component-based digital hardware authoring with proofs</li>\n  <li>A software case study: <a href=\"https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto\">Fiat Cryptography</a>, supporting correct-by-construction auto-generation of fast code for elliptic-curve cryptography</li>\n  <li>Pointers to where to look next, if you would like to learn more about this technology</li>\n</ul>",

        "abstract": "On October 1st the Catalan society held a referendum to decide if they wanted to stay part of the Spanish state or create an independent state. This talk will explain the internet censorship which took place in the weeks before the referendum, on the very same day as well as in the timer after the referendum.",
        "description": "The talk will focus on the methods used by the state to carry out the censorship. These included websites informing about the referendum and information about the polling station each citizen had to use. I will describe how the censorship got circumvented and give an insight in the systems developed to facilitate an easy cloning of the information.\n\nOn the day of the referendum it was expected that the Spanish police will close down polling stations. Therefor a global census accessible via internet was introduced which allowed the vote at any polling station. I will describe how this global census was organised to block people from voting twice. I will explain in which different ways the census got attacked by the Spanish state. And of course what we can learn from the state censorship to create more resilient infrastructures.",

To realize this complex orchestration, avatar\u00b2 enables communication and state synchronization between a variety of popular tools, such as Qemu, OpenOCD, GDB, PANDA and angr.\n\nWhile the declared scope of avatar\u00b2 the is analysis of embedded firmware, this talk will also show that the framework can also be useful in other contexts, such as scripting gdb in python from outside gdb, or loading the state of a concretely executed binary into angr.",

With some colleagues, we have studied how we could use debug components available in most ARM processors to create security mechanisms targeting a wide range of attacks (buffer overflows, ROPs\u2026) with minimal performance overheads.\nWe use CoreSight debug components in with a technique called dynamic information flow tracking (aka DIFT) which allow us to monitor the execution of an application at runtime. Compared to existing works, we show that there\u2019s no need to modify the main processor (existing binaries will be compatible!). Furthermore, we used a coprocessor implemented in reconfigurable logic (FPGA chip) to speedup the DIFT process.\nThis ARM/FPGA combo is up to 90% faster than related techniques in terms of instrumentation time. Furthermore, as the ARM CPU has not been modified (while existing works do modify it\u2026), the final user doesn\u2019t have to recompile all his/her programs to be compatible with our approach.\nWe will also show a few clues to indicate how we could target multi-threaded/multi-processor architectures as it is the case of most embedded systems by now.\n",

        "subtitle": "Get a unique tour of some of the world\u2019s most unusual networks, led by a Cuban hacker",
        "abstract": "Internet access in Cuba is notoriously restrictive. ETECSA, the government-run teleco, offers 60 wireless hotspots in parks and hotels, allowing foreigners and citizens alike to \"visit\" the Internet for only $1/hour\u2026 That\u2019s what most tourists know about the Internet in Cuba, but of course, that can't be the whole story!\n\nIn this talk, we'll take a deeper look at what life is like for Cuban hackers, and we\u2019ll get to tour a vibrant set of community-driven networks that typical tourists never see. The story that emerges is an inspiring view of what communities can (and can\u2019t) accomplish in the face of adversity.\n",
        "description": "Internet access in Cuba is a study in resilience. By the official numbers, the island seems hopelessly disconnected: Cuba ranked last in the Americas in the ITU\u2019s 2016 ICT development index, having only 5.6% household Internet penetration, and international bandwidth per user measures a mere 572 bits/s. Yet Cubans have developed a number of bottom-up, community-oriented responses to these limitations.\n\nThis talk will focus on three indigenous networks that aren't seen by the typical tourist. These include \u201cEl Paquete\u201d, a sneaker-net distribution of media files that\u2019s passed around the country on USB sticks and hard drives, and which may be Cuba\u2019s largest source of private employment. There is also the Cuban educational network, which connects more than 20 higher education institutions around the country. Perhaps most unusual is Havana\u2019s \u201cStreet Network\u201d, or SNET, a vast unsanctioned IP network, constructed by volunteers using salvaged equipment. Though entirely isolated from the Internet, the SNET connects over 50,000 residential users across the capital city, and it\u2019s home to a vibrant community and hundreds of websites.\n\nIn describing these three systems, we'll draw lessons about what is necessary for network communities to survive and thrive in the island\u2019s challenging environment, including places where flexibility and compromise have been essential. Cuba presents a highly unusual regulatory and technological environment, and the approaches that have succeeded there are both inspiring and demonstrative of what communities can (and can't) accomplish through organic, distributed networks.",

        "description": "Around the world communication is increasingly monitored and restricted. If communication can not be eavesdropped on, it is often blocked entirely. Less advanced states even block the entire internet nation-wide.\n\nWe need to develop tools that are more resilient to these threats. Communication and expression needs to be free. Censorship should not be possible. Even if the internet was taken down, people should still be able to communicate.\n\nThis presentation will introduce Briar a resilient messaging app. Its goal is to enable people in any country to create safe spaces where they can debate any topic, plan events, and organize social movements.\n\nBriar does not rely on servers. It connects people directly peer-to-peer and does not care how data is exchanged. Currently, it has plugins for Bluetooth, WiFi and Tor. The latter is used for long-distance communication over the internet and is supposed to not leak metadata.\n\nBriar aims to be secure and easy to use at the same time. An Android app is currently in beta. Support for other platforms is planned.\n\nSince Briar works peer-to-peer, there is no single universal truth in it. Each group of people might have a different view on the available data depending on their connectivity. This opens up some interesting technical and usability problems that you do not encounter in centralized systems where the server is the authority.",

I will discuss the current state of immigration enforcement in the US and associated surveillance capabilities, the results of a study with undocumented immigrants about their technology practices, and the takeaways for the technology and privacy community in supporting communities of heightened risk.",
        "description": "In this talk, I will first discuss the current state of immigration enforcement in the United States, including recent immigration policy changes, known surveillance capabilities of enforcement agencies, and recent efforts by these agencies that hint at an expansion of technical sophistication. I will then discuss lessons and insights from a series of interviews we conducted with undocumented immigrants and immigrant rights organizations about this community\u2019s technology practices, risk awareness, and security and privacy behavior online. We find that in the face of acute risk of detention, harassment, and deportation, this community is well-versed in managing risks offline. Their most common strategies for managing risk online\u2014self-censorship and controlling access to spaces\u2014are largely the same techniques used in the physical world. However, the immigrants we interviewed are extremely uncertain about the effectiveness of their defenses against adversaries online, which are typically conceptualized as nebulous and all-knowing.\n\nWe find that managing privacy and immigration status disclosure, a responsibility that rests not only with individuals but in communities, is more complex online. This is in part due to a diminishing sense of control online over where and how information is exposed. Furthermore, this community places a surprising amount of trust in the platforms that host their community spaces, which exposes a potentially dangerous gap in understanding about information collection and use by companies. Based on our findings, I will discuss what technologists, security tool developers, and activists should be aware of in order to more effectively support communities of heightened risk in protecting themselves online.

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "Type confusion, often combined with use-after-free, is the main attack vector to compromise modern C++ software like browsers or virtual machines. Typecasting is a core principle that enables modularity in C++. For performance, most typecasts are only checked statically, i.e., the check only tests if a cast is allowed for the given type hierarchy, ignoring the actual runtime type of the object. Using an object of an incompatible base type instead of a derived type results in type confusion. Attackers have been abusing such type confusion issues to compromise popular software products including Adobe Flash, PHP, Google Chrome, or Firefox, raising critical security concerns.\n\nWe discuss the details of this vulnerability type and how such vulnerabilities relate to memory corruption. Based on an LLVM-based sanitizer that we developed, we will show how to discover such vulnerabilities in large software through fuzzing and how to protect yourself against this class of bugs.",
        "description": "C++ is popular in large software projects that require both the modularity of object-oriented programming and the high efficiency offered by low-level access to memory and system intrinsics. Examples of such software are Google Chrome, Microsoft Windows, Mozilla Firefox, or Oracle's JVM.  Unfortunately, C++ enforces neither type nor memory safety. This lack of safety leads to type confusion vulnerabilities that can be abused to attack programs.  Type confusion arises when the program interprets an object of one type as an object of a different type due to unsafe typecasting, leading to reinterpretation of memory areas in different contexts.  For instance, a program may cast an instance of a parent class to a descendant class, even though this is not safe if the parent class lacks some of the fields or virtual functions of the descendant class. When the program subsequently uses these fields or functions, it may use data, say, as a regular field in one context and as a virtual function table (vtable) pointer in another. Exploitable type confusion bugs have been found in a wide range of software products, such as Adobe Flash (CVE-2015-3077), Microsoft Internet Explorer (CVE-2015-6184), PHP (CVE-2016-3185), and Google Chrome (CVE-2013-0912). According to Microsoft, type confusion is the 4th most common vulnerability type in their bug bounty program (after use-after-free, memory corruption, and heap out-of-bounds read) with the majority of type confusion bugs also fitting into one of the earlier categories.\n\nWe have developed an extension to the Clang/LLVM compiler that detects type-confusion bugs with low overhead and high coverage. Our prototype consists of two parts: an object tracing facility and typecasting verification. Such an enforcement mechanism is useful as a runtime monitor and online defense mechanism to protect applications against attacks. In a development setting, the mechanism can be combined with a fuzzing framework to detect type confusion before the underlying memory corruption triggers.\n\nIn this talk we will first discuss how type safety protects against type confusion-based attacks. We will then introduce our prototype implementation and show how it actively defeats realistic attacks. Finally, we show how to leverage type safety in a fuzzing framework to find security vulnerabilities faster.  We will release all components as open-source.\n\nWe introduce the concept of a type sanitizer that checks all casts in an application (replacing static casts with fully explicit runtime checks) and show how we have developed a low-overhead framework for these checks. Building on this framework we argue that it can be used as a runtime monitor in an always on configuration to protect users against attacks and how developers, security researchers, and hackers can use it to find new vulnerabilities in real software.\n\nThe expected audience includes people interested in system software, reverse engineering, fuzzing, type confusion-based attacks, and memory corruption-based attacks and their defense mechanisms. General programming and low-level knowledge is expected but the talk will be self contained and does not expect the audience to know the upcoming defense mechanisms or attacks.",

These abstractions may or may not be a good fit for your language or application, but you have no choice but to use them - you can only layer more abstractions on top of them, to try to lessen the pain of a bad match.

It can be comprehensible, documentable, testable, and hackable with your everyday tools.

        "abstract": "ClaimChain is a Public Key Infrastructure unique in that it can operate in fully decentralized settings with no trusted parties. A vouching mechanism among users, similar to the Web of Trust, assists with social authentication but without revealing the users' social graph. High-integrity data structures prevent equivocation and help detect compromises; the protocol can support generic claims (conventional PGP, modern OTR/Signal etc.); and a prototype evaluation indicates that ClaimChain can scale.",
        "description": "Blockchain holds a big promise for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) designs. Prominent systems, such as Keybase and CONIKS, tend to be centralized, something that eases the update of keys and provides good availability. Centralized designs, however, require users to trust that the source of authority acts honestly at all times, and does not perform surveillance.<br>\n\nClaimChain is a decentralized PKI design, where users maintain repositories of claims implemented as hash chains: data structures that allow for efficient verification of the integrity and authenticity of their content. Claims relate to the key material of the owners, or their beliefs about public keys of others. In the latter case, cross-referencing serves as a way of efficient and verifiable vouching about states of other users. In practice, such information would reveal the social graph of the chain owners and even their communication patterns. To solve this privacy issue, we use cryptographic verifiable random functions to derive private identifiers that are re-randomized on each chain update, encrypted to a given set of authorized readers. In that way, chain owners can not present different views to authorized readers of the same contact. ClaimChain allows to detect chain compromises, manifested as forks of hash chains, and to implement various social policies for deriving decisions about the latest state of users in the system.<br>\n\nEvaluation of a prototype implementation indicates that ClaimChain can scale to accommodate the needs of large groups at an acceptable computational and bandwidth overhead cost. Interoperability with PGP makes it possible for users to gradually deploy ClaimChain locally. Email providers that wish to adopt ClaimChain will participate as an additional factor in the social authentication process. Arguably, ClaimChain constitutes an example that decentralization in combination with modern cryptography allow for increased robustness to adversarial central authorities, and offer comparable availability, as well as more options for supporting privacy.",

Streaming services Tidal, Deezer and Pandora as well as Groovers (Korea) 7digital and HDmusicstream offer MQA-streaming at a higher price-point as their regular offerings (20.- per month instead of 10).\n\nCompanies like Onkyo, Pioneer, Sony, Rotel and NAD offer hifi-products supporting MQA and some smartphone makers like LG incorporated it too.\n\nMQA consists of a container format and a licensing regime for audio DACs.\n\nMQA files will play on any redbook-capable device and can be freely copied. The lowest bit of the file is used to store compressed spectral content above 24k and a control bit.\n\nIf a MQA licensed DAC detects an MQA file it will \u201cunfold\u201d the high-rez content and turn on a blue light on the DAC.\n\nA lot of effort for a switching on a blue light ;)\n\nThis talk will both scrutinize the DRM-regime of MQA and the sound-quality narrative. \n\nIn the context of the latter we will look at MQAs assertion that the Shannon-Nyquist theorem is inadequate for audio-sampling as it purportedly introduces \u201ctemporal inaccuracies.\u201d MQA claims to have incorporated \u201cnew psychoacoustic research\u201d and advances beyond Shannon-Nyquist in sampling theory. The exact nature of this innovations remain unclear as MQA technology is proprietary and no independent third-party research is available.\n\nWe will discuss these claims and show the status of the numerous MQA reverse-engineering efforts. So far it is know that MQA is PCM-based, uses minimum-phase filters and destructive compression for parts of the spectrum. It also lowers the available dynamic range and exhibits no behaviour proving any of their claims made in the marketing material. Still MQA at least managed to get the almost unequivocal support of the audio-press and at the same time is hotly debated online.\n\nWith regards to the DRM aspect we will look at the marketing strategy of MQA and show how the company so far successfully controlled the narrative by narrowing the understanding of DRM to copying. The MQA DRM uses a both symmetric encryption as well as a PKI-component to authenticate files and devices. The DRM involves a clever mix of permissive licensing towards behaviour like copying while discriminating access by level of quality.\n\nHere we will discuss in how far such licensing design might be a model for future DRM-deployments and marketing.\n\nFinally we will discuss the systemic dimension of MQA in the context of music-streaming and control over assets like content, playback-devices (DACs) and licenses. With the platforms controlling the streaming market and playback devices (iPhone, Amazon smart speakers etc) on the one side, the record companies owning the content on the other side, MQA seems to attempt to establish licensing leverage for the content owners.",

Once the system is in a known good state, the TPM is used as a hardware key storage to decrypt the drive.\n\nAdditionally, the hypervisor, kernel and initrd images are signed by keys controlled by the user, and the OS uses a signed, immutable root filesystem so that any software exploits that attempt to gain persistence will be detected.  While all of these firmware and software changes don't secure the system against every possible attack vector, they address several classes of attacks against the boot process and physical hardware that have been neglected in traditional installations, hopefully raising the difficulty beyond what most attackers are willing to spend.",

Even though this strategy is rewarded by rapidly increasing customer numbers, it also reveals a flawed understanding of security.

        "description": "Over the last few years, smartphones have become an omnipresent device that almost everybody owns and carries around all the time. Although financial institutions usually react conservatively to new technologies and trends, most established banks today offer their customers banking apps and app-based second-factor authentication methods. Fintechs, technology startups in the financial sector, pressure the tried and trusted structure of established banks, as they highlight the customer\u2019s smartphone as the hub of their financial life. This business model is especially appealing to younger customers. FinTechs, however, also play an important role in the advancing downfall of important conceptual security measures. While the latter can be understood as the next step in the decay process of second-factor authentication, which was started with the introduction of app-based legitimization methods, FinTechs also reveal limited insights into conceptual and technical security. We have encountered severe vulnerabilities at the Berlin-based FinTech N26, which offers their smartphone-only bank account to many countries throughout Europe. Entirely independent of the used device, we were not only able to reveal N26 customers and to manipulate transactions in real-time but also to completely take over a victim\u2019s bank account.",

We use the notion of a \"necessary causal factor\" to investigate the causes of accidents, and almost invariable there is a combination of both technical and human causal factors.\n\nI will look in some detail at accidents in which a combination of a technical problem, misleading or missing indications, and inappropriate (but often understandable) crew actions contributed to an accident, and also some in which unprecedented actions of the human crew turned a problem with potentially fatal consequences into a survivable accident.\n\nAutomation in modern airliners has become so reliable and useful that it may be argued that it leads to a deterioration of hand-flying skills and, perhaps more importantly, of decision-making skills.\n\nSample accident cases will include Asiana Flight 214, Spanair Flight 5022, Turkish Flight 1951, TAM Flight 3054 and others.

And that even AES128 on top of the BTLE layer doesn't have to mean \"unbreakable\". Our main target will be electronic locks, but the methods shown apply to many other smart devices as well...",
        "description": "This talk will hand you all the tools you need to go deeply into hacking smart devices. And you should! The only reason a huge bunch of these products doesn't even implement the most basic security mechanisms, might be that we don't hack them enough!\n\nWe start by looking at the hardware layer, dissecting PCBs and showing which chips are usually used for building those devices. Even if the firmware is read protected they still can be used as nice devboards with unusual pheripherals - if you can't flash it, you don't own it!\n\nBut you don't always have to get out your JTAG interfaces. The most simple part is intercepting an Apps communication with its servers. We show an easy Man-in-the-middle setup, which on the fly breaks the TLS encryption and lets you read and manipulate the data flowing through. This was enough to completely defeat the restrictions on a locks \"share to a friend\" feature and of course helps you recover your password...\n\nUnderstanding the API also is the best way to actually OWN your device - giving you the option to replace the vendors cloud service with an own backend. We show how this can be for example used to continue using your bike lock when the kickstarter you got it from goes bankrupt after a presentation about it's bad crypto. Just kidding, they are already notified and working on a patch. \n\nAlso going for the wireless interface and sniffing BTLE isn't as difficult as it might sound. Turning a cheap 10 EUR devboard into a sniffer we show how to use Wireshark to dissect the packets going from and to the device and analyze the payload. In some cases this is all what's needed to get the secret key from a single interaction...\n\nFinally we will turn into reverse engineers, showing how to decompile an android app and analyze it's inner working or even modify it to your needs. Using this we show, that a quite popular electronic padlock indeed correctly claims to use AES128, but due to a silly key exchange mechanism we can break it by listening to a single opening command. All details of this 0-day attack will be released during the talk - the vendor has been notified in May.\n\nLast but not least we will go back for the hardware layer, showing that sometimes even simple things like magnets or shims can be used to defeat $80+ electronic locks in seconds...",

However, with the increasing complexity of console hardware, it's becoming impractical for a small team of hackers to create a full blown development SDK. Using leaked official SDKs is illegal. What can we do? Well, there's Linux.\n\nThe PS4 is particularly great for Linux, because it is based on a modified x86 platform and a modified Radeon GPU. That means that once the basic OS port is complete, it can run existing games - even Steam games and other commercial software. But just how similar is the PS4 to a PC? Can you just throw GRUB on it and boot an Ubuntu kernel? Not quite.\n\nIn this talk we'll cover the PS4 hardware and part of its software environment, and how we reverse engineered enough of it to write Linux drivers and kernel patches. We'll go over how we went from basic code execution to building a 'kexec' function that can boot into Linux from the PS4's FreeBSD-based kernel. We'll reverse engineer the PS4's special hardware, from special PCI interrupt management to the HDMI encoder.  We'll dive deep into the Radeon-based GPU architecture, and we'll share some previously unreleased research and tools of interest to AMD Radeon driver developers and hackers.\n\nIf you're interested in the strange world of x86 hardware that isn't quite a PC, then this talk is for you.",

We introduce two versions of the attack. The more general form exploits multiple unnoticed protocol flaws in SSLv2 to develop a new and stronger variant of the Bleichenbacher RSA padding-oracle attack. The victim client never initiates SSLv2 connections. We implemented the attack and can decrypt a TLS 1.2 handshake using 2048-bit RSA in under 8 hours, at a cost of $440 on Amazon EC2. Using Internet-wide scans, we find that 33% of all HTTPS servers and 22% of those with browser-trusted certificates are vulnerable to this protocol-level attack due to widespread key and certificate reuse.\n\nFor an even cheaper attack, we apply our new techniques together with a newly discovered vulnerability in OpenSSL that was present in releases from 1998 to early 2015. Given an unpatched SSLv2 server to use as an oracle, we can decrypt a TLS ciphertext in one minute on a single CPU\u2014fast enough to enable man-in-the-middle attacks against modern browsers. We find that 26% of HTTPS servers are vulnerable to this attack.\n\nThis talk gives an overview on the DROWN vulnerability for the hacker community with some background information that didn\u2019t make it to the paper.",

        "subtitle": "Prejudice in Word Embeddings",
        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning are in a period of astounding growth. However, there are concerns that these technologies may be used, either with or without intention, to perpetuate the prejudice and unfairness that unfortunately characterizes many human institutions. We show for the first time that human-like semantic biases result from the application of standard machine learning to ordinary language\u2014the same sort of language humans are exposed to every day. We replicate a spectrum of standard human biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological studies. We replicate these using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model\u2014namely, the GloVe word embedding\u2014trained on a corpus of text from the Web. Our results indicate that language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics. In addition to our empirical findings concerning language, we also contribute new methods for evaluating bias in text, the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and the Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT). Our results have implications not only for AI and machine learning, but also for the fields of psychology, sociology, and human ethics, since they raise the possibility that mere exposure to everyday language can account for the biases we replicate here.",
        "description": "There is no Alice and Bob in this talk. This talk is intended for an audience that genuinely cares for humanity and believes in equality while supporting fairness and acts against discrimination. This talk might not be interesting for folks who promote exclusion while discouraging diversity. Many of us have felt excluded in certain situations because of our gender, race, nationality, sexual orientation, disabilities, or physical appearance. This talk aims to communicate how big data driven machine learning is pushing the society towards discrimination, unfairness, and prejudices that harm billions of people every single day.\n\nThis year, I will not talk about de-anonymizing programmers, re-identifying underground forum members, or anonymous writing. I will be talking about a human right, namely equality, and the issue of unfairness which happens to be embedded in machines that make decisions about our future, what we see and read, or whether we go to prison or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\nMachine learning models are widely used for various applications that end up affecting billions of people and Internet users every day. Random forest classifiers guide the U.S. drone program to predict couriers that can lead to terrorists in Pakistan. Employers use algorithms, which might be racist, to aid in employment decisions. Insurance companies determine health care or car insurance rates based on machine learning outcomes. Internet search results are personalized according to machine learning models, which are known to discriminate against women by showing advertisements with lower salaries, while showing higher paying job advertisements for men. On the other hand, natural language processing models are being used for generating text and speech, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and sentence completion, which collectively influence search engine results, page ranks, and the information presented to all Internet users within filter bubbles. Given the enormous and unavoidable effect of machine learning algorithms on individuals and society, we attempt to uncover implicit bias embedded in machine learning models, focusing particularly on word embeddings. We show empirically that natural language necessarily contains human biases, and the paradigm of training machine learning on language corpora means that AI will inevitably imbibe these biases as well. \n\nWe look at \u201cword embeddings\u201d, a state-of-the-art language representation used in machine learning. Each word is mapped to a point in a 300-dimensional vector space so that semantically similar words map to nearby points. We show that a wide variety of results from psychology on human bias can be replicated using nothing but these word embeddings. We primarily look at the Implicit Association Test (IAT), a widely used and accepted test of implicit bias. The IAT asks subjects to pair concepts together (e.g., white/black-sounding names with pleasant or unpleasant words) and measures reaction times as an indicator of bias. In place of reaction times, we use the semantic closeness between pairs of words. In short, we were able to replicate every single implicit bias result that we tested, with high effect sizes and low p-values.\n\nThese include innocuous, universal associations (flowers are associated with pleasantness and insects with unpleasantness), racial prejudice (European-American names are associated with pleasantness and African-American names with unpleasantness), and a variety of gender stereotypes (for example, career words are associated with male names and family words with female names). We look at nationalism, mental health stigma, and prejudice towards the elderly. We also look at word embeddings generated from German text to investigate prejudice based on German data. We do not cherry pick any of these IATs, they have been extensively performed by millions of people from various countries and they are also available for German speakers (https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/germany/).\n\nWe go further. We show that information about the real world is recoverable from word embeddings to a striking degree. We can accurately predict the percentage of U.S. workers in an occupation who are women using nothing but the semantic closeness of the occupation word to feminine words! These results simultaneously show that the biases in question are embedded in human language, and that word embeddings are picking up the biases. \n\nOur finding of pervasive, human-like bias in AI may be surprising, but we consider it inevitable. We mean \u201cbias\u201d in a morally neutral sense. Some biases are prejudices, which society deems unacceptable. Others are facts about the real world (such as gender gaps in occupations), even if they reflect historical injustices that we wish to mitigate. Yet others are perfectly innocuous. Algorithms don\u2019t have a good way of telling these apart. If AI learns language sufficiently well, it will also learn cultural associations that are offensive, objectionable, or harmful. At a high level, bias is meaning. \u201cDebiasing\u201d these machine models, while intriguing and technically interesting, necessarily harms meaning.\n\nInstead, we suggest that mitigating prejudice should be a separate component of an AI system. Rather than altering AI\u2019s representation of language, we should alter how or whether it acts on that knowledge, just as humans are able to learn not to act on our implicit biases. This requires a long-term research program that includes ethicists and domain experts, rather than formulating ethics as just another technical constraint in a learning system.\nFinally, our results have implications for human prejudice. Given how deeply bias is embedded in language, to what extent does the influence of language explain prejudiced behavior? And could transmission of language explain transmission of prejudices? These explanations are simplistic, but that is precisely our point: in the future, we should treat these as \u201cnull hypotheses\u2019\u2019 to be eliminated before we turn to more complex accounts of bias in humans.",

        "description": "Version 1.3 is the latest Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which allows client/server applications to communicate over the Internet in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery. TLS is the S in HTTPS.\n\nA lot has changed between 1.2 (2008) and 1.3. At the a high level, 1.3 saves a round-trip, making most connections much faster to establish. We'll see how the 1.2 handshake worked, and what had to change to enable 1-RTT handshakes.\n\nBut even more importantly, the 1.3 design shifted towards putting robustness first. Anything that is not strictly necessary to the main function of TLS was removed (compression, renegotiation); choices of suboptimal security aren't offered at all (static RSA, CBC, RC4, SHA1, MD5); secure, easy to implement designs are introduced or privileged (RSA-PSS, AEAD implicit nonces, full handshake signatures, Curve25519, resumption forward secrecy). We will go into the why and how of all of these.\n\nBut two major trade-offs had to be made: first, 1-RTT handshakes inherently prevent the introduction of encrypted domain names (SNI). We'll see why and what can replace them to provide similar privacy.\n\nMost interestingly, 1.3 comes with 0-RTT resumption. The catch there is that the protocol itself provides no complete protection against replay attacks. We'll unpack the problem, see what mitigations are available, what the risks and attacks are and how that requires careful API design and deployment.\n\nFinally, deployment hasn't been entirely smooth. Many servers out there turned out to be intolerant to 1.3 clients. We'll see what this causes, how it was worked around, and how downgrade protection provides defense in depth.\n\nTLS 1.3 is not in the distant future. The draft is almost finalized, and at Cloudflare we developed an open source stack in Go and support the protocol in beta for all websites. Chrome Canary and Firefox Nightly implement 1.3 clients.",

        "description": "Scanning networks is a basic tool for security researchers. Software misconfiguration like with unprotected key-value stores and  software bugs like heartbleed are analyzed and investigated in the wild using scanning of networks.\n\nAt least since the rise of zMap, scanning the I---Pv4---nternet has become a rather simple endeavour. When one happens to be at a conference that tends to supply 1gE or 10gE ports on the access layer, scanning the Internet can be done in 60-10 Minutes. Scanning the 2^32 possible addresses (with certain limitations) of IPv4 has become cheap.\n\nHowever, the small searchspace of IPv4 that makes it so scannable is also what renders it increasingly obsolete. To overcome this issue, IPv6 was designed. Along with IPv6 we receive a theoretical maximum of 2^128 different addresses. Scanning this larger space is a challenge that---so far---has been mostly approached by researchers. Specifically, not security but network measurement researchers. Their works usually focus on having access to large datasets of  IPv6 addresses, the most famous ones using the access logs of a large CDN. \n\nWith the average nerd lacking a small enterprise scale CDN in the basement, we set out to utilize other techniques for enumerating IPv6 that only utilizes public data sources. Following RFC7707, we found various interesting candidate techniques. Especially probing the PTR sets of IPv6 networks sounded promising.\n\nHowever, when implementing the techniques, we had to realize that these were not yet ready to be used on a global scale. During the last couple of months we discovered pitfalls, adjusted the tools and ran enumerations.\n\nIn this talk we will present the approaches we used to enumerate IPv6. From this presentation, the average person in the audience should be able to easily implement these tools for them self---with subsequent \"spasz am geraet\". Furthermore, we will present anecdotes, case-studies and investigations on the data we gathered so far. This includes peeks into transit networks of large ISPs, datacenters of global cloud providers and a suprisingly high amount of things one would not expect (or hope to be) on the Internet.",

The most studied microarchitectural attacks are beyond doubt cache attacks. Indeed, the timing of a memory access depends heavily on the state of the CPU cache. But beyond memory accesses that are the base of classical cache-based side-channel attacks, other x86 instructions leak information about the internal state of the hardware, and thus about running programs. First, we present side channels caused by the \"clflush\" instruction, that flushes all content of the cache. We will explain how it can be used to perform side-channel attacks that are faster and stealthier than their classical counterpart, without performing so much as a single memory access [1]. Second, we present side channels caused by the prefetch instructions. We will explain how these instructions can be used to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses - without the use of the proc interface that is restricted today -, and to bypass kernel ASLR [2].\n\nThis talk does not require any knowledge about assembly. We promise.\n\nThe talk will be given as a joint presentation by Cl\u00e9mentine Maurice and Moritz Lipp.\n\n\n\n[1] Daniel Gruss, Cl\u00e9mentine Maurice, Klaus Wagner and Stefan Mangard, \"Flush+Flush: A Fast and Stealthy Cache Attack\", DIMVA 2016\n[2] Daniel Gruss, Cl\u00e9mentine Maurice, Anders Fogh, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard, \"Prefetch Side-Channel Attacks: Bypassing SMAP and Kernel ASLR\", CCS 2016",

        "abstract": "Software Defined Radios (SDRs) became a mainstream tool for wireless engineers and security researches and there are plenty of them available on the market. Most if not all SDRs in the affordable price range are using USB2/USB3 as a transport, because of implementation simplicity. While being so popular, USB has limited bandwidth, high latency and is not really suitable for embedded applications. PCIe/miniPCIe is the only widespread bus which is embedded friendly, low latency and high bandwidth at the same time. But implementing PCIe/miniPCIe is not for the faint of heart - you have to write your own FPGA code, write your own Linux kernel driver and ensure compatibility with different chipsets, each with its own quirks. In this talk we will look at the requirements for a high performance SDR like XTRX, how this leads to certain design decisions and share pitfalls and gotchas we encountered (and solved).",
        "description": "We've been working with SDRs since 2008 and building own SDRs since 2011, focusing on embedded systems and mobile base stations. We created ClockTamer configurable clock source and UmTRX SDR and built a complete base station (UmSITE) to run OpenBTS and later Osmocom GSM stacks. This year we've started working on a new tiny high-performance SDR called XTRX which fits into the miniPCIe form-factor and using PCIe for the I/Q samples transfer.\n\nWe will talk about when to use PCIe and when not to use PCIe and why did we choose it for XTRX; FPGA implementation of PCIe with optimization for low latency and high throughput; Linux kernel driver for this PCIe device; integration with various SDR platforms; all the various issues we encountered and how you can avoid them.",

Um was geht es dabei? Und was k\u00f6nnen wir daraus f\u00fcr andere F\u00e4lle lernen?",
        "description": "Im Vortrag wird klar werden, warum politischer Aktivismus so wichtig ist und dass er eigentlich gar nicht so schwer ist, wenn man ein paar Dinge beachtet.\n\nEs hat drei Jahre gebraucht, um die nutzerunfreundliche Praxis des Routerzwangs endlich gesetzlich f\u00fcr ung\u00fcltig zu erkl\u00e4ren. Diese erm\u00f6glicht es Internetanbietern, ihren Kunden ein Endger\u00e4t aufzuzwingen, auf das sie nur geringen Einfluss nehmen k\u00f6nnen. Schlimmer noch: Will man einen eigenen Router anschlie\u00dfen, etwa weil man bestimmte technische Dienste ben\u00f6tigt, Ger\u00e4te auf Basis Freier Software bevorzugt oder ein stromsparenderes Modell einsetzen m\u00f6chte, ist dies bei vielen Anbietern entweder gar nicht m\u00f6glich oder man wird bei Support-Anfragen diskriminiert. Dieses Verhalten von Providern ist in vielerlei Hinsicht h\u00f6chst problematisch, da es hohe Sicherheitsrisiken f\u00fcr Nutzer birgt, fairen Wettbewerb verzerrt und den technologischen Fortschritt hemmt.\n\nUnd seit einigen Monaten steht die EU-Richtlinie f\u00fcr Funkabschottung auf unserer Agenda, die m\u00f6glicherweise schon bald die Nutzung und Entwicklung von Freier Software auf allen Ger\u00e4ten, die in irgendeiner Art Funkwellen verwenden, enorm einschr\u00e4nkt.\n\nDie Free Software Foundation Europe, f\u00fcr die der Referent Max Mehl arbeitet, hat schon seit den ersten Debatten vor \u00fcber drei Jahren gegen den Routerzwang angek\u00e4mpft und dabei viele Erfahrungen gesammelt. In Zusammenarbeit mit Freie-Software-Entwicklern, Organisationen wie dem Chaos Computer Club oder Digitalcourage sowie mit Endger\u00e4teherstellern, Verb\u00e4nden und Politik ist es gelungen, den Routerzwang gesetzlich offiziell ab Sommer 2016 zu beenden.\n\nEin wesentlicher Grund f\u00fcr den Erfolg der Initiative war die Einigkeit innerhalb der Allianz gegen den Routerzwang, dass dieses Problem nur politisch gel\u00f6st werden kann. Technisch g\u00e4be es f\u00fcr einige der aufgelisteten Kritikpunkte sicherlich kurzfristig L\u00f6sungen, doch aus Erfahrung wissen wir, dass das ein Kampf gegen Windm\u00fchlen w\u00e4re und sich das Grundproblem nur weiter verfestigen w\u00fcrde. Dasselbe Ziel verfolgen wir auch f\u00fcr die Funkabschottung.\n\nDer Referent will daher dazu ermutigen, dass sich mehr Menschen f\u00fcr politische L\u00f6sungen von \u00e4hnlichen Missst\u00e4nden einsetzen. Dazu wird er zum einen den Verlauf des Routerzwangs kurz zusammenfassen und dann anhand dessen skizzieren, wie \u00e4hnliche Probleme \u2013 im gro\u00dfen wie im kleinen Ma\u00dfstab \u2013 angegangen werden k\u00f6nnen: unter anderem durch ausf\u00fchrliche Informationsbeschaffung, den Aufbau von Kontakten, gute Kommunikation und das Aufbauen von Allianzen. W\u00e4hrenddessen wird klar werden, dass man f\u00fcr erfolgreichen politischen Aktivismus kein Hauptzeitlobbyist sein muss, sondern Vielf\u00e4ltigkeit sogar von Vorteil ist.\n\nBildcredit: Konrad Twardowski, CC BY-SA 2.0",

Instead of trying to fix our CPUs by reverse-engineering large amounts of proprietary blobbiness, I propose we move as much sensitive data as possible out of these compromised systems.\n\nIn practice, the architecture I propose places a trusted interposer into the compromised system's display bus (LVDS, (e)DP or HDMI) that receives in-band control data containing intact ciphertext (read: PGP/OTR encoded into specially formatted RGB pixel data) and that transparently decrypts, verifies and renders the decrypted data into the pixel data stream.\n\nThe resulting system looks almost identical from a user-interface perspective, but guarantees plaintext message data is never handled on the compromised host CPU while all the juicy computational power and fancy visual effects that one provides remain intact.\n\nI will outline the implementation problem areas of this approach and some possible solutions for them.

In addition, Woolim contains a remarkable hardening and jails the user to protect the integrity of the system. The tablet itself and the Apps that are preinstalled provide a rare insight into DPRK\u2019s development in the IT sector. We will lift the fog on the internals of Woolim and provide a deep dive into the internals of the tablet PC.\n\nOver the past years DPRK released several different tablet PCs. This talk will focus on what seems to be the latest device called Woolim (\uc6b8\ub9bc), which is the Korean word for \u201eecho\u201c. It was build in late 2015 and the device is an outstanding piece of technology designed to jail users to predefined functionality and track the user's behavior.\n\nWe will start by giving an introduction to the hardware specifications of the tablet. The device is equipped with a wide variety of applications. Users are able to read and create documents, watch movies, visit websites and play games. There are also a bunch of dictionaries on the device. We will give an introduction to the most interesting applications and features of the tablet.\n\nThe applications that come with Woolim give a rare insight into how technology is used and distributed in DPRK. All of the applications on Woolim have been touched by DPRK, even games like Angry Birds have been modified. The features implemented to jail the user and protect the integrity of the system will also be in focus for this talk.\n\nWe have published a detailed analysis of a watermarking mechanism in DPRK\u2019s Red Star OS last year, speculating that the code in Red Star OS already contains some preparations for a far more sophisticated watermarking mechanism. We have identified such advanced mechanisms in Woolim and will give a technical insight on how they prevent distribution of unwanted media more effectively.\n\nDPRK continues to develop surveillance technology that is hidden inside consumer hardware. It\u2019s goal seems to be to enable total control of it\u2019s users in terms of tracking the distribution of media files and preventing unwanted information in the DPRK ecosystem. Implementing such features into smartphones or tablet PCs like Woolim allows even more effective surveillance of DPRK citizens. Therefore, we will try to shed some light on the privacy invading features of Woolim.",

We will explain newly found vulnerabilities in the 'unserialize' mechanism of the language and present re-usable primitives for remote exploitation of these vulnerabilities.",
        "description": "PHP is the most prominent web server-side language used today. Although secure coding practices are used when developing in PHP, they can\u2019t mitigate vulnerabilities in the language itself. Since PHP is written in C, it is exposed to vulnerabilities found in projects written in a low-level language, such as memory-corruption vulnerabilities, which are common when manipulating data formats. PHP-7 is a new implementation of the language, and while memory corruption bugs exist in this version as well, none of the exploitation primitives from the previous version are working (e.g. @i0n1c presentation from BH2010). \nIn this talk, I will discuss the memory internals of PHP7 from exploiter and vulnerability researcher's perspective, explain newly found vulnerabilities in the unserialize mechanism and demonstrate how to exploit this class of bugs in PHP-7 presenting re-usable primitives.\nThe internals of the language implementation changed quite dramatically, and now it\u2019s harder to find and exploit memory corruption bugs. The new zval system prefers embedding over pointing to members and the allocation mechanism has gone through a complete re-write, removing metadata. The overall result is less primitives and less control over crafted data. unserialize is a data manipulation and object instantiation mechanism in PHP which is prone to memory corruption vulnerabilities.  For the first time, we have managed to implement a remote exploit of a real world bug in PHP-7unserialize mechanism.",

        "description": "First we show that the 802.11 random number generator is flawed by design, and provides an insufficient amount of entropy. This is confirmed by predicting randomly generated group keys on several platforms. We then examine whether group keys are securely transmitted to clients. Here we discover a downgrade attack that forces usage of RC4 to encrypt the group key when transmitted in the 4-way handshake. The per-message RC4 key is the concatenation of a public 16-byte initialization vector with a secret 16-byte key, and the first 256 keystream bytes are dropped. We study this peculiar usage of RC4, and find that capturing 2 billion handshakes can be sufficient to recover (i.e., decrypt) a 128-bit group key. We also examine whether group traffic is properly isolated from unicast traffic. We find that this is not the case, and show that the group key can be used to inject and decrypt unicast traffic. Finally, we propose and study a new random number generator tailored for 802.11 platforms.",

Wir berichten dar\u00fcber, wie wir das angengangen sind, wie es ausgegangen ist und was wir dabei gelernt haben.\nZudem machen wir einen Ausblick auf kommende netzpolitische Herausforderungen.",
        "description": "In Sachen Netzpolitik hat sich im Jahr 2016, seit unserem letzten Vortrag zu dem Thema, viel getan.\n\nGleich zu Beginn 2016 kam die Nachricht, dass das Referendum zum NDG erfolgreich war. Damit hat das Schweizer Stimmvolk die Chance erhalten, \u00fcber das Geheimdienstgesetz (NDG) abzustimmen. Mit dem Zustandekommen des Referendums war aber erst die halbe Arbeit getan. \n\nEs galt nun der in Gang gesetzten staatlichen Propagandamaschinerie sowie einigen, insbesondere b\u00fcrgerlichen, Parteien entgegenzuwirken. Die netzpolitischen Gruppierungen waren also gefragt, sich aktiv, parteipolitisch unabh\u00e4ngig und mit technischen Fakten in den Abstimmungskampf einzubringen. Am 25. September 2016 hat dann das Schweizer Stimmvolk \u00fcber das neue Nachrichtendienstgesetz entschieden: 65% der Bev\u00f6lkerung hat das gesetz angenommen, nur gerade 35 % teilten unsere Meinung.\n\nIm Fr\u00fchling hat das Parlament gleich das n\u00e4chste fragw\u00fcrdige Gesetz verabschiedet - das revidierte Bundesgesetz betreffend die \u00dcberwachung des Post- und Fernmeldeverkehrs (B\u00dcPF). Auch gegen dieses Gesetz hat die Schweizer Netzgemeinde, unterst\u00fctzt von einer ganzen Reihe Jungparteien, umgehend das Referendum ergriffen. Das Sammeln der Unterschriften wurde diesmal aus den R\u00e4umen des CCC Z\u00fcrich (CCCZH) koordiniert, da es sich abgesehen von der stark netzpolitisch verankerten Pirtatenpartei, nicht um eine parteipolitische Initiative handelte. Auch wenn das Referendum gegen das B\u00dcPF leider nicht erfolgreich war, so haben wir bei der Zusammenarbeit mit einem gross gestreuten Kommittee, beim Sammeln auf der Strasse und dem Ausz\u00e4hlen und bescheinigen der Unterschriften viel gelernt und somit nicht Gold, aber immerhin Silber und Bronze abger\u00e4umt.\n\nAuch wenn mit 2016 ein - mit Bezug auf die Schweizer Netzpolitik - besonders d\u00fcsters Jahr zu Ende geht, so ist f\u00fcr die Zukunft noch einiges ausstehend. Zum Schluss wollen wir einen kurzen \u00dcberblick geben \u00fcber das was kommt.\n\nDetaillierte Erkl\u00e4rungen zum politischen System in der Schweiz und der (damals) aktuellen Lage haben wir im Vortrag am 32c3 gegeben: https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7205-netzpolitik_in_der_schweiz\n\nIm Anschluss an den Talk gibt es eine ausgedehnte Diskussions- und Fragesession zu den behandelten Themen im Raum A.1: Siehe hier: https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Session:Netzpolitik_in_der_Schweiz_2017",

Ich will erz\u00e4hlen was Hochaufl\u00f6sungsmikroskopie ist, die drei verschiedenen Ans\u00e4tze dazu (PALM/STORM, STED, SIM), wie sie sich erg\u00e4nzen und wie die technologische Entwicklung des 21. Jahrhunderts das erst m\u00f6glich gemacht hat. Wie Techniken basierend auf Laserphysik (STED), stochastischem Blinken von Molek\u00fclen (PALM/STORM) oder schneller Fouriertransformation (SIM) uns erm\u00f6glichen tiefer in Zellen hinein zu schauen \u2013 und man sich pl\u00f6tzlich Gedanken dar\u00fcber machen muss wie man etwas in einem Bild darstellt, dass eigentlich gar kein richtiges Bild ist, sondern ein vielschichtiges Messergebnis. Aber auch die Community in diesem Feld ist interessant. Langsam aber sicher verbreitet sich der open science Gedanke, immer mehr Software ist Quelloffen, es gibt sogar einen J\u00e4hrlichen Wettbewerb f\u00fcr die beste Bildrekonstruktionssoftware, immer mehr Anleitungen zum Eigenbau machen die Runde, wie zum Beispiel Arduino L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr Kameratimings, Laser aus Discobeleuchtungen und hier und da finden sich auch offene Daten. Trotzdem werden Mikroskope wohl nie dem Teleskop den Rang ablaufen, denn das was man als interessierter Bastler, oder auch als Profi auf diesem Gebiet, zu Hause anstellen kann ist begrenzt. Was geht will ich auf der B\u00fchne zeigen mit kosteng\u00fcnstigen USB-Mikroskopen und evtl. mit einem kleinen Eigenbau.",

Since more than 20 years now, ROOT helps them with interactive development of analysis algorithms (in the context of the experiments' multi-gigabyte software libraries), serialization of virtually any C++ object, fast statistical and general math tools, and high quality graphics for publications. I.e. ROOT helps physicists transform data into knowledge.\n\nThe presentation will introduce the life of data, the role of computing for physicists and how physicists analyze data with ROOT. It will sketch out how some of us foresee the development of data analysis given that the rest of the world all of a sudden also has big data tools: where they fit, where they don't, and what's missing.\n",

And while we enjoyed the little time of reckless banditism, playing cowboys of the early interconnected age, we also soon welcomed the public realization that we were right all along, that information technology was going to change everything, and that information security was critical. Now, the Internet governs our lives.\n\nSuccess always comes with strings attached. \n\nThe Internet morphed with us. Once an unexplored space we were wandering in solitude, now it has become a marketplace for goods, *the* vehicle for communication, as well as an instrument for control, and a field for battle.\n\nWe learned the many ways it was abused and broken. We learned the stories of those who were victims of the shortcomings of computer and network systems, and we realized how often and brutally they were turned into means of persecution against those who struggle for free speech and democracy around the world.\n\nIn this lecture I wish to reflect on the maturation of the security and hacking communities and their role in larger societal and political participation.

Statt diese Positionen argumentativ zu untermauern, was oft gar nicht m\u00f6glich oder zumindest wenig \u00fcberzeugend ist, wird oft mit Stereotypisierungen und Scheinargumenten gearbeitet. Oft verweisen Populisten auf das \"Recht des St\u00e4rkeren\" (der Mehrheit) und stellen das als \"demokratisch\" dar, obwohl der Minderheitenschutz ein wesentliches Merkmal demokratischer Systeme ist. Gleichzeitig wird eine Minderheit zum S\u00fcndenbock gemacht. Eine populistische Forderung wird sprachlich oft auf eine einfache Formel gebracht (\"Obergrenze\", \"Kinder statt Inder\", \"Fl\u00fcchtlingswelle\", \"Leistung muss sich wieder lohnen\" usw.), wobei oft mit bestimmten Tricks gearbeitet wird, z.B. mit Unterstellungen (genauer: Pr\u00e4suppositionen bzw.

Although they will likely give up on trying to regulate or prohibit encryption, we should expect that malware and law enforcement hacking will play a starring role in the next battle in the crypto wars.",
        "description": "In a world where encryption is increasingly the norm, the cops aren\u2019t going to give up and go home. No, they\u2019ll target our scarily insecure mobile devices and computers. How did we get here, what's going on, and what can we do to stop it? Come to this talk to find out.\n\nFor more than fifteen years, the FBI has had a dedicated hacking team. Until recently, this team\u2019s hacking operations were shrouded in near-complete secrecy. That is slowly starting to change. And while we still don\u2019t know a lot, what we have learned is alarming. For example, in order to deliver malware, the FBI has impersonated journalists and engaged in bulk-hacking operations that targeted users of legitimate communications services (TorMail).\n\nAs the next crypto wars unfold in Washington, London and Brussels, we should expect to see law enforcement hacking play a central role in the debate. With the mass, default adoption of full disk encryption storage and end-to-end encryption for communications, law enforcement agencies will no doubt struggle to acquire data that has traditionally been easy for them to get. This will likely result in two significant policy shifts \u2013 first, it will force law enforcement hacking out of the shadows, and second, it will cause hacking tools to trickle down from elite, well-resourced federal law enforcement units to regional and local cops, who are most impacted by encryption, the least technically sophisticated and the most likely to abuse hacking tools.\n\nIf a world in which the FBI hacks is scary, just wait until local police departments are doing it too.\n\nWe must stop the spread of hacking as a law enforcement tool, before it is too late.",

In order to answer this question, we are analysing the available titles and abstracts of Congress talks from 1984 until now.  This ongoing research seeks to identify changing trends, significant outliers, apparent patterns and common threads throughout the years.  We also wonder if it is possible to identify turning points in the narrative.  The empirical data is contextualised by reflections on the shifting ground of technology, politics and society in the world during the long history of the CCC, as well as by qualitative reflections of attendants.

        "abstract": "Applied IT security is largely a science-free field. The IT-Security industry is selling a range of products with often very questionable and sometimes outright ridiculous claims. Yet it's widely accepted practice among users and companies that protection with security appliances, antivirus products and firewalls is a necessity. There are no rigorous scientific studies that try to evaluate the effectiveness of most security products or strategies. Evidence-based IT security could provide a way out of the security nihilism that's often dominating the debate \u2013 however it doesn't exist yet.",
        "description": "From Next-Generation APT-Defense to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: The promises of IT security product vendors are often bold. Some marketing promises are simply impossible, because they violate a fundamental theorem of computer science, the halting problem.\n\nMany IT security professionals are skeptical of security appliances, antivirus software and other IT security products and call them snake oil. Furthermore security products often have security vulnerabilities themselves, which has lately been shown by the impressive work done by Tavis Ormandy from Google's Project Zero.\n\nWhen there's disagreement about the effectiveness of an approach then rational people should ask for scientific evidence. However, surprisingly this evidence largely doesn't exist. While there obviously is a lot of scientific research in IT security it rarely tries to answer practical questions most relevant to users. Decisions are made in an ad-hoc way and are usually based on opinions rather than rigorous scientific evidence. It is quite ironic that given the medical analogies this field likes to use (viruses, infections etc.), nobody is looking how medicine solves these problems.\n\nThe gold standard of scientific evidence in medicine (and many other fields) is to do randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of those trials. An RCT divides patients in groups and a treatment \u2013 for example a new drug \u2013 is compared against a placebo treatment or against the current best practice. Single trials are usually not considered sufficient, therefore meta-analyses pool together the results of all trials done on a particular question. There's no reason RCTs couldn't be applied to the question whether a particular security product works.\n\nEvidence-based medicine is undoubtedly the right approach, but these methods aren't without problems. Publication Bias skews results, many studies cannot be replicated and the scientific publishing and career system is often supporting poor scientific practices. But this doesn't question the scientific approach itself, it just means that more rigorous scientific practices need to be implemented.\n\nUnfortunately, in the few cases where controlled studies are done in the Infosec world they often suffer from the most basic methodological problems like being underpowered (too few participants), never being independently replicated or not measuring relevant outcomes. (There are a few studies on password security and similar questions.)\n\nApplying rigorous science to IT security could provide a way out of the security nihilism that dominates the debate so often these days - \u201cEverything is broken, everyone's going to get hacked eventually\u201d. And by learning from other fields Evidence-Based IT Security could skip the flaws that rife other fields of science.",

Das Ganze wird bunt, unterhaltsam und anschaulich passieren, so dass es f\u00fcr Techies und Nicht-Techies eing\u00e4ngig ist. Warum sind manche Artikel lang, manche kurz? Kann man Artikeln ansehen, ob die Redakteure wirklich dahinter stehen oder nicht? Welche Redakteure sind enger miteinander verbandelt als andere?

        "description": "Despite its ubiquitous application and widespread acceptance, mobile instant messaging remains a complex matter and is often not understood by its users. Easy-to-use apps and security assurances by their developers suggest users a safe and private environment for conversation. At the same time, more and more apps flood the market and it is becoming increasingly difficult, even for technically-educated users, to keep track of both technological development and their own security and privacy requirements. We want to present a talk that sheds some light into technical aspects of mobile instant messaging and presents an overview of techniques and design decisions by different mobile instant messaging app developers. We aim at both technically-educated and casual users alike, trying to present simple analogies and break down complex details into understandable components. After an introduction to the mobile instant messaging world, we will dissect one of the most popular mobile instant messaging apps in Germany: Threema. It is closed-source and only superficially documented, yet widely used. We picked it for a particular design decision in its protocol, the lack of which we consider the most important flaw in competitor protocols like Signal: the use of discardable IDs in favor of phone numbers. Another interesting aspect about Threema\u2019s protocol is its use of the NaCl library for end-to-end encryption. We have fully reverse-engineered the Threema app and can therefore analyze and present its protocol and our analysis of it in detail.",

        "subtitle": "How to write an open source bit-bang low-speed USB stack running on a sub-$1 Cortex M0+",
        "abstract": "How to get USB running on an ARM microcontroller that has no built in USB hardware.  We'll cover electrical requirements, pin assignments, and microcontroller considerations, then move all the way up the stack to creating a bidirectional USB HID communications layer entirely in software.",
        "description": "USB is amazing.  It's hot-pluggable, auto-negotiating, and reasonably fast.  It's robust, capable of supplying power, and works cross-platform.  It lives up to the \u201cUniversal\u201d claim: your PC definitely has USB, but it may not have TTL Serial, I2C, or SPI available.  Hardware USB support is available in all manner of embedded microcontrollers.  However it's not available on all microcontrollers, and integrating a hardware USB PHY can double the cost of a low-end microcontroller.   This problem is particularly acute in the sub-$1 microcontrollers: a companion USB PHY chip would typically cost more than the microcontroller (example: the MAX3420E USB-to-SPI adapter costs around $5), so your only option for USB is to get your hands dirty and bit bang the missing protocol.\n\nThis talk describes the implementation of a new bitbanged USB stack, starting with a primer on the USB PHY layer and continuing up the stack, concluding with \"Palawan\", a feature-complete open-source bitbanged USB Low Speed stack available for use on microcontrollers priced for under a dollar.  We'll go over requirements for getting USB to work, as well as talking about USB timing, packet order, and how to integrate everything together.\n\nUnlike other bitbang USB implementations such as V-USB and LemcUSB, Palawan makes fewer assumptions about GPIO layout.  With Palawan, USB's D+ and D- signals can be on different GPIO banks, and need not be consecutive.  By doing so, more pins are available to the user, making it easier to use with devices that have special restrictions on what pins can do what.  The only requirements are that both GPIO pins can be both inputs and push-pull outputs, and that at least one pin can be used as an interrupt.\n\n Palawan also includes a USB HID firmware update mechanism to allow for updates to be installed even on platforms that normally require USB drivers.\n\nAs a protocol, USB comes in multiple speeds.  The base speeds are called Full Speed and Low Speed -- FS and LS respectively.  FS runs at 12 Mbps, and LS runs at 1.5 Mbps.  LS is more restricted in scope than FS.  It limits packet data payload size to 8 bytes (down from 64), and only allows Control or Interrupt endpoints (so no Bulk or Isochronous endpoints).  While it's true that this limits the total possible features we can implement, it means that the job of implementing them in software becomes simpler.  Limiting communications to 8-bytes of payload data also significantly lowers memory requirements.\n\nThe core USB PHY layer consists of two functions: USBPhyRead() and USBPhyWrite().  These functions transparently take care of bit stuffing and unstuffing, where long runs of data have a transition period inserted.  They also take care of synchronizing reception to the incoming signal, as well as interpreting SE0 end sequences, recognizing USB keepalive packets, and adding the USB SE0 footer.  This particular implementation takes care to ensure incoming packets are presented in the correct endianness, as USB packets are transmitted with the most significant byte first.\n\nSince the PHY code is written using cycle-counting, it must be run from memory that is cycle-accurate.  The Kinetis parts we used for testing have variable-cycle flash, so we must first copy the data into RAM and execute from there.  Fortunately, gcc makes it easy to put executable code in the .data section, and automatically generates calls to RAM.\n\nThe core of the USB PHY layer is written in Thumb2 assembly for an ARM Cortex M0+ using ARMv6m.  This is an extremely limited subset of ARM code that removes lots of fun stuff like conditional execution, different source and destination registers in opcodes, as well as DSP instructions.  As a tradeoff, most instructions complete in one cycle, with the notable exceptions of branches (which are two cycles if taken) and loads/stores (which are two cycles unless it involves single-cycle IO).  USB is 1.5 Mbit/s, and at 48 MHz that gives us 32 cycles to write the data out two ports, calculate bit [un]stuffing, check for end-of-packet, and load the next chunk of data for writing.\n\nThe the USB PHY layer makes the following assumptions:\n\n  +\t The controller is a 48 MHz Cortex M0+ with associated two-stage pipeline\n  +\t GPIO is single-cycle access (sometimes referred to as Fast GPIO or FGPIO)\n  +\t GPIO has separate \"Set Value\" and \"Clear Value\" banks.\n  +\t GPIO pin direction register is 1 for output, 0 for input\n  +\t Code is executing from single-cycle access memory, meaning it may need to execute from RAM\n\nDespite these limitations, this code has been ported to two different Freescale/NXP Kinetis parts under a variety of operating systems.  These assumptions aren't terribly restrictive, meaning this core could easily be ported to other M0+ implementations.\n\nOther bit-banged USB implementations make assumptions that were not useful for our implementation.  V-USB impressively works on an AVR microcontroller across a range of frequencies, but it is the wrong architecture and uses special timer modes unavailable on ARM.  LemcUSB is conceptually similar to Palawan and is available for other M0+ chips, and in fact can run at a lower clock speed of 24 MHz.  However, LemcUSB requires that D+ and D- be on a GPIO bank's pins 0 and 1 respectively, which is not available on all chips, or may conflict with the SWD pins.  Additionally, the M0+ ISA has no instruction for reversing word order, so LemcUSB's low-level PHY functions return data reversed.  Palawan takes care to load bits in the correct order, saving a step when examining the packet.\n\nOur sample implementation is accompanied by a bootloader that provides a USB HID communication. This allows for driver-free firmware updates even on Windows, which normally requires a signed driver installation.  This USB HID code can act as a keyboard, but is also bidirectional, and is capable of allowing for firmware upload to the device.  While there are bootloader HID implementations from companies such as NXP and Microchip, we are unaware of any general-purpose open-source USB HID bootloader created with the intention of providing firmware updates.",

        "abstract": "This talk discusses the representation of Arab males in video games and the adverse effect it has on the collective political imagination. Anonymous military-aged Arab men become increasingly the exception to the laws of human rights, and become default targets for conventional and unmanned drone attacks. This devolution is seen through the lens of the changing nature of conflict through digitalization, the collapse of the nation state in Iraq and Syria, and the future of war. ",
        "description": "In the popular video game series \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\", Arab men are consistently depicted as the mindless throngs of the indestinguishable enemy. The First Person Shooter (FPS) genre lends itself to killing enemies, usually many in the same round, but the evolution of the target went from Nazi's in Wolfenstein 3D in 1992, to targets that become increasingly comparable to Arabs and Muslims in the following years. So besides historically oriented games that focus on the combatants of World War II, most games since the 1990's begin to shift their focus to another kind of enemy--one that suspiciously looks Arab or Islamic. Even Sci-Fi epics like the Halo series, which take place may hundreds of years in the future, the enemies start taking on an exotified look and feel, and follow an obviously religious ideology that is inimical to universal peace. The smallest insignificant alien becomes a strategic risk as they become \"suicide bombers\" blowing themselves up before they die, expressing a sigh of cowardice before they die. \n\nIn \"Modern Warfare 2\", something suprising happens. The Arab characters are given a little more depth and backstory, and the Arabic dialogue is the most realistic of any of the other games. It also becomes the version of the game that is most modified by users (in so-called \"mods\"). Hacked and converted to other versions, there is significantly a version used by Al-Qaeda for recruitment purposes. The production company responsible, Infinity Ward, later had its two chief developers and founders fired under mysterious circumstances. \n\nAs a researcher on radical Islamic thought, over the years I have collected some materials about video games and their uses for recruitment and ideological training on the Jihadist side. What I would like to do for 33C3 is show versions of the modded games parrallel to the originals in a face-off setting, and give a lecture about the background to these games. I will explore stories of recruitment from American soldiers, and how these games factored into their decision to join the U.S. military. Through the digital realm, I will propose a new framework for understanding the so-called Huntingtonian \"Clash of Civilizations\"--where very recent cultural artifacts become automatic motivations. As a drone operator sees the pixelation of a real Arab male on the screen, it is an image he's shot at in the virtual domain over and over again since he was a child.  The Arab male has devolved from being a human being (in the way that women or children, or caucasian males are) to being mere fodder, a natural target where you simply just shoot. ",

        "description": "Randomness is a fundamental, security-critical resource in the wider security ecosystem utilized by everything from cryptographic software (eg. key and nonce generation) to exploit mitigations (eg. ASLR and stack canary generation). Ideally secure random number generation is done using a dedicated hardware True Random Number Generator (TRNG) collecting entropy from physical processes such as radioactive decay or shot noise. TRNGs, however, are both relatively slow in their provision of random data and often too expensive to integrate in a system which means computer systems have to resort to a software (cryptographically secure) Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG). Such a CSPRNG is seeded (both initially and continuously) from a variety of sources of 'true' entropy which are effectively stretched into additional pseudo-random data using cryptographic methods. Since the design and implementation of such CSPRNGs is a complicated and involved effort, many operating systems provide one as a system service (eg. /dev/(u)random on UNIX-like systems) and as a result many security software suites assume their existence.\n\nThe embedded world, however, poses a variety of unique challenges (resulting from constraints and deployment scenarios, which differ significantly from the general-purpose world) when designing and implementing (CS)PRNGs. Resulting inadequacies in embedded OS random number generators have led to various security failures in the past (from weak cryptographic keys in network devices to broken exploit mitigations in smartphones) emphasizing the need for public scrutiny of their security, especially considering the nature of embedded system deployments (in everything from vehicles and critical infrastructure to networking equipment) and the sheer variety of ebmedded operating systems compared to the general-purpose world. In this talk we will discuss various challenges posed by the embedded world to (CS)PRNG design and implementation and illustrate our arguments by means of the first public analysis of the OS random number generators of several popular embedded operating systems and a discussion of how their flaws related to these previously identified challenges.

Aber was machte z.B. ein Kaffeeriecher? Er war kein Hipster-Barista, sondern ein Auswuchs der Politik von Friedrich II.: durch den Schmuggel von Kaffeebohnen sah sich Friedrich II gen\u00f6tigt, ausgediente Kriegsveteranen durch Berlin zu schicken. Sie durften in die H\u00e4user der B\u00fcrger eindringen, um unversteuerten Kaffee aufzufinden. Sie verletzten dabei die Privatsph\u00e4re und schn\u00fcffelten buchst\u00e4blich nach einem Vergehen. Anders als die \u00dcberwachung im Netz heute waren sie laut und derb und nicht unsichtbar. Den B\u00fcrgern waren sie so verhasst, dass sie sich gegen sie aufb\u00e4umten. Nach nur acht Jahre war der Spuk vorbei, die Kaffeeriecher wurden durch Protest des Volkes ausrangiert. W\u00e4re es heute nur so einfach.\n\nAkribisch nach Fakten, Formen und Verbindungen suchend, entstand auch die Auftragsarbeit \u201eAltes Handwerk\u201c , f\u00fcr die Stiftung Preu\u00dfischer Kulturbesitz: ein Jahr lang w\u00fchlte Michaela Vieser in den Archiven des BPK: zum Teil lagen die Bilder in einer alten Kegelbahn in einem Offizierskasino in Charlottenburg.

In this current moment of climate crisis and structural metamorphosis how can we work with powerful immersive technologies to understand our own perceptual systems, to radically communicate and to innovate new ways of being together?",
        "description": "Our physical body and the spaces we inhabit seem very real, but what is this sense of reality \u2013 of presence in the world \u2013 and is it simply a story told to us by our brain, a neural fiction? Just over a decade ago, neuroscientists at Princeton discovered the \u2018rubber hand illusion\u2019, a way of persuading the brain to incorporate a fake hand into its internal body image, so that the fake hand became a felt part of the body. Since then, scientists and virtual reality experts have developed \u2018full body\u2019 illusions showing how our attachment to our whole body is somehow provisional and flexible. \n\nThe talk will consider these strange findings and what potentials are emerging through creative VR projects. I will discuss my own work with Virtual Reality, which investigates how immersive audio, visual, touch and haptic environments enable us to \"slip our moorings\" and experience transformed relationships to our environment, to other people and to our own bodies. I\u2019ll describe the interdisciplinary experimentation undertaken in the Sackler Centre's Labs and the development of visual technologies and multi-sensory techniques that invite audiences to investigate the architecture of their own subjective experience for themselves.\nOur understanding of what it is to be human is undergoing a dramatic seachange: a biological, embodied, emotional and fundamentally social understanding of human subjectivity is emerging across disciplines. These powerful immersive technologies and techniques for hacking the human sensory system have uses beyond entertainment. This session will end by outlining some ways ahead for creatively working with this tech to bring us into deeper relationship with the systems we live in and distant ecosystems, other people and the vital feelings of our own bodies.\n",

However, there is a silver lining for researchers in this proliferation: by reselling the same commercial \u201clawful intercept\u201d tool and network infrastructure to multiple countries, and training operators in the same attack techniques, companies are creating patterns that we can use to identify surveillance across a wide range of different actors.\n\nUsing the Mansoor attack as a case study, we will provide a window into how researchers at Citizen Lab leverage and fingerprint these patterns to track nation-state level attacks against human rights defenders and journalists. Drawing on cases from the UAE and beyond, we will discuss how we work with targets and victims, conduct Internet scanning, and fingerprint C&C servers. We will conclude with a discussion of some trends that we have observed in commercial malcode sold to nation state actors.",

        "subtitle": "Introducing the Love to Code Platform",
        "abstract": "The participation of women in computer education is low; undergraduate classrooms in Germany were only 10% female in 2000[1]. The picture at the primary school level is fuzzier, as students do not declare majors at that level, but evidence indicates the trend starts from a young age. Can we make computer education more gender-inclusive? Presenting technology in familiar, non-threatening contexts can lead to more balanced gender participation. For example, Chibitronics uses the context of papercraft to present electronics to beginners; the familiarity of papercraft improves the participation of women of all ages in the creation of electronics. Based on these learnings, we have devised the \u201cLove to Code\u201d platform, an open source hardware-to-cloud stack which combines the familiarity of paper craft with a web-based, driver-free embedded firmware development environment based on FSK audio provisioning via a headphone jack. In this talk, we will dive into the novel open source technical contributions of this platform, which includes the audio-based provisioning protocol and the unique rigid-flex design of the circuitry enabling papercraft integration, as well as the multi-threaded client OS and cloud infrastructure required to complete the picture. This combination of new technology with familiar interfaces aims to lower the barrier to computer education, thus making coding a more accessible and inclusive activity.",
        "description": "Computer technology tends to be a male-dominated field. One study from 2002 placed female participation in undergraduate computer education classrooms around 10% for Germany, and 26% for the US[1]. The picture is fuzzier at the primary school level, because students do not declare majors at such a young age, but evidence indicates that this strong gender bias has roots extending to primary school. Can we make computer education more inclusive? There is evidence that presenting technology in familiar, non-threatening contexts can lead to more inclusive participation. \n\nAs an example, Chibitronics uses the context of paper craft to present electronics to beginners. Paper craft \u2013 the art of manipulating and coating paper as exemplified by origami or painting \u2013 has universal accessibility among almost all ages, genders, and ethnic groups. In our approach, novices start with the familiarity of paper, and combine it with copper tape and electronic stickers to build circuits.\n\nDemographic analysis of the Chibitronics user base indicates this approach is succeeding at gender inclusivity: over 70% of individual buyers are female. Follow-up interviews indicate that Chibitronics acts as a gateway to more advance projects and skills. After bootstrapping into basic electronics, users pick up skills such as soldering to build larger and more permanent projects. \n\nWe would like to continue this trend beyond circuit crafting and into the realm of embedded firmware coding. Creating parallel and series combinations of LEDs and switches can only go so far; users rapidly outgrow the basic techniques and want to add patterns and interactivity to their projects through coding.\n\nCoding for the web is as simple as learning a text editor and pointing a browser at a URL, but coding for an embedded hardware target, such as an Arduino, inevitably requires platform-specific drivers, which can require installation and debugging. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that primary school educators rarely possess the skillset to install, debug, and maintain a classroom of computers for embedded development. Furthermore, the waning popularity of laptops and desktops means the most inclusive platforms are now mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, even though their touchscreen keyboards are not ideal for extensive programming. \n\nIn order to tackle the problem of inclusivity, we make embedded firmware development nearly universal by coupling a cloud-based editing and compilation infrastructure with an audio-based firmware upload protocol suitable for implementation on low-cost microcontrollers. Cloud-based editing and compilation eliminates the barrier of downloading and running a C compiler on the client, while the audio-based firmware upload protocol allows virtually any computer, smartphone, or tablet to communicate with target hardware implementing our demodulator. We demonstrate this end-to-end solution via the Chibitronics \u201cLove To Code\u201d (LtC) open source hardware platform.\n\nUsers code for their LtC boards using Arduino-flavored C++ as a baseline language by visiting our demo site (either https://chibitronics.com/ltc (CodeMirror editor) or https://chibitronics.com/cb (Codebender/ACE editor)). Users enter their code on the client-side editor, which is then uploaded as plain text to a cloud-based C++ compiler and returned as an object code binary. The binary is then packetized, coded and modulated using browser-side Javascript into an FSK audio stream with a baud rate of 8000 bps. The frequency plan was chosen to minimize interaction with audio \u201cenhancement\u201d filters found in devices such as iPhones, and to enable the raw audio stream to be recorded as a 128kbps CBR MP3 with minimal distortion. This allows pre-compiled binaries to be stored as songs; one could even entertain the thought of cutting these songs into vinyl records and provisioning microcontrollers using nothing more than an analog turntable. \n\nThe FSK audio stream is coupled from the headphone jack into the microcontroller PCB via a modified microUSB cable. The USB interface is used only for power; the data pins are inert during the provisioning process. Audio arrives at the LtC hardware via the \u201cfifth pin\u201d in the microUSB plug that is normally reserved for identifying A or B type devices. This hack allows users to power programmed LtC devices using any regular microUSB cable. \n\nWithin the LtC device, the audio signal is DC coupled and level-shifted using a passive RC network into a single ADC pin on an NXP CPU, the MKL02Z32VFK4. This 48 MHz Cortex M0+ features 32k of FLASH and 4k of RAM and costs under $1 in modest volumes, less than one third the cost of the AVR used in the Arduino Leonardo. The microcontroller uses noncoherent demodulation to recover the bitstream. The received data is hash-checked for integrity and, if it passes, is committed to FLASH memory. Since our code is open source, one can add FSK audio provisioning to a wide range of microcontrollers with built-in ADCs for the price of a couple resistors and a capacitor.\n\nBecause microphone jack pin assignments are non-standard between different device ecosystems, we designed the protocol to operate with only forward error correction through trivially redundant transmission of packets. In other words, we cannot rely on a feedback path being available for the device to request a retransmission of a corrupt packet, due to a lack of standardization among microphone interfaces. Fortunately, in our application, the signal to noise ratio is typically quite good and most errors are due to burst noise, e.g. a notification tone generated by another application during device programming. In this scenario, simple hamming codes (such as SECDED) do little to improve robustness of the protocol, and more advanced error correction mechanisms such as BCH codes requires more computational power and storage space than available in our inexpensive target device. As a result, we handle error correction through trivial replication of data by playing the song three times over.\n\nIn addition to the audio firmware downloader code, the target CPU also runs an implementation of the open source, multi-threaded RTOS ChibiOS (no relationship to Chibitronics despite the Japanese-derived \u201cchibi\u201d prefix). We expose the threading API so that advanced users can create multi-threaded applications on LtC. This is an advantage over the popular Arduino platform, which has no native support for multi-threading.\n\nIn order to reduce code upload times over an 8000bps link to within the \u201cimpatience limit\u201d of an 8-year old, we pre-load the LtC device with common shared library routines, including floating point, string manipulation, a WS2812 RGB LED driver, and primitives for a low speed USB stack. Because of the library pre-load, we are able to reduce the upload time of most simple programs to under two seconds. The built-in libraries, audio demodulation framework, and multi-threaded OS consumes 22k of memory, leaving 10k for user application code.\n\nLearning from our prior experiences with paper electronics, the physical design of the LtC hardware borrows from familiar and non-threatening interaction paradigms. The LtC circuit board uses a rigi-flex construction: the rigid portion allows for mechanically robust connectors and compatibility with fine-pitch QFN packages, while the flex portion enables seamless integration with paper-based circuit techniques. \n\nAs a result, users can integrate the LtC hardware into their projects using a variety of techniques, from sticker-like methods to an electronic clipboard paradigm. The electronic clipboard method is well-suited to classroom environments, as it combines unlimited re-use of the LtC hardware with low-cost, quickly customized and paper-craftable circuitry. This combination enables meaningful learning engagements within an hour of two of classroom time, at a price point accessible by non-elite, publicly funded institutions. \n\nFinally, the entire framework is licensed under an open source license. Our hope is that once a novice is hooked on coding, they can go as deep as they want, perhaps even remixing our hardware and firmware frameworks into new and creative applications we never had never dreamed of.\n\nThe Chibitronics Love to Code platform is familiar: users with little or no prior technical background find themselves immediately in familiar territory thanks to the papercraft interaction design. It is easy to use: cloud compilation coupled with audio firmware upload ensures compatibility with a broad range of devices from laptops to smartphones. It is accessible: the combination of cost-optimized core technology with paper as a consumable substrate reduces the barrier of access for schools on tight budgets. The net result is an embedded coding framework for inclusive computer education. \n\n\n[1] V. Galpin, SIGSCE Bulletin, Vol 34 No 2, 2002 June. \u201cWomen in Computing Around the World\u201d",

We generally call this unknown substance \"dark matter\" / \"dark energy\". The recent discovery of gravitational waves gives us a handle on the dark cosmos. We can now listen to invisible events in our universe. But there may also be other methods to shed light on the dark side.",
        "description": "There is (much) more than meets the eye: 95% of everything there is in the universe does not interact with normal matter. It is completely transparent. Does not emit light. Reflects no light waves. Can be neither seen nor touched. The only reason we know it exists is the fact that this unknown substance curves spacetime: it interacts gravitationally. Hence gravitational wave astronomy can target the entire universe while conventional telescopes are fundamentally limited to only 5% of the cosmos. After the initial direct detection of gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) last year, many more observatories on ground and in space are under construction that will create a wideband gravitational wave detector network. We will be able to listen to stars falling into black holes, colliding galaxies, maybe even artificial sources of gravitational waves, and will find as yet completely unknown objects in the universe.\nBut gravitational waves are not the only handle we have on the dark side of the cosmos. Many other research teams aim to directly detect dark matter. The Any Light Particle Search (ALPS) even tries to artificially generate dark matter particles in a controlled laboratory environment. It is under construction at the German Electron Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg, Germany. First results are expected as early as 2019.\n\nThis lecture will give you a brief and fun introduction to cosmology and Einstein's general relativity. We will explore different known sources of gravitational waves and their associated frequency range. You will understand how LIGO detected the first gravitational wave signature. Join us to learn about upcoming earthbound observatories and space missions like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

        "description": "Cellular modems are not only present in smartphones, tablets and laptops, but these days also in many M2M and internet-of-toilets (IoT) applications. Long gone are the days where those modules were GSM/GPRS/EDGE only with ancient ARM7TMDI or ARM926EJS cores and a relatively small-sized firmware in the range of kilobytes to very few megabytes, like on the famous OsmocomBB supported phones.\n\nModern cellular modems re-use the cellular chipsets of smartphones one or two generations ago, like the MDM9615 used in the iPhone 5.  As those chipsets contain plenty of processors and are quite sophisticated SoCs on their own, one can even find (undocumented) Linux or Android in some modems, which of course makes them a very attractive target for further exploration or running your own code inside the modem.\n\nWe will give a short overview about the current market of cellular modems, the major chipset suppliers and chipset families and then pick one or two examples and show the methods used for reverse engineering them to a point where they can be used for much more than the AT command or QMI interface officially documented/supported by the manufacturer. This includes the execution of custom code inside modems, as well as protocol tracing of the air-interface.  We'll also look at the FOTA (Firmware Update Over The Air) features, and perform a security analysis of our findings.\n\nThis talk understands itself following the tradition of various baseband processor related talks at many CCC events of the past decade, including <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/Fahrplan/events/3008.en.html\">25C3: Anatomy of smartphone hardware</a> and <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4735.en.html\">28C3: Reverse-engineering a Qualcomm baseband</a>.\n\nBoth speakers (Harald Welte and Holger Freyther) have been working on Free Software related to cellular telephony for more than a decade, including projects like <a href=\"http://openmoko.org/\">Openmoko</a>, <a href=\"http://openbsc.osmocom.org/\">OpenBSC</a>, <a href=\"http://bb.osmocom.org/\">OsmocomBB</a> and many other <a href=\"http://osmocom.org/\">Osmocom</a> projects.",

Minds are generative systems: they actively produce the world that we subjectively experience. Ordinary day-time experiences are in fact dreams constrained by sensory data. This simple insight of contemporary cognitive science turns realist notions of embodiment on their head. The idea of the brain as a dreaming machine opens a way to understand the nature of our experiences.\n\nThis is the proposed fourth installment of a series of presentations about using AI perspectives to understand minds and their relationship to the universe. \"How to build a mind\" (30c3) suggested specifications for an architecture of cognition; \"From computation to consciousness\" (31c3) explored the mind's computational foundations; \"Computational metapsychology\" (32c3) discussed the individual and social construction of meaning. \"Machine dreams\" sketches how the computational machinery of our brains leads to our experience a subjective world. We will look at the conductor theory of consciousness, some of the mental structures contributing to our models of self and world, and the unreasonable effectiveness of neural processes in modeling physics.",

        "description": "Imagine no WiFi, no cell phones, no bluetooth. (Everything\u2019s better with bluetooth!) \nIt is often said that we owe the convenience of all these modern technologies to Hollywood actress Hedy Lamarr and her invention of Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) in the early 1940s. Do we?\n\nBorn Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler on November 9, 1914, the daughter of an affluent Viennese family became famous at age 18 for starring naked and faking the first onscreen orgasm in history in the Czech-Austrian film \u201cEkstase\u201d \u2013 fame which led to a successful Hollywood career after Hedwig Kiesler emigrated to the USA and renamed herself Hedy Lamarr. \u201cThe most beautiful woman in the world\u201d, as director Max Reinhardt called her, starred in more than two dozen Hollywood movies over the course of twenty years, all the while being bored by the intellectual limitations her job offered. On the subject of what it takes to be a Hollywood sex symbol, she is quoted to have said \u201cAny girl can look glamorous. All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.\u201d\n\nLamarr had always been interested in science and technology and wanted to help the United States' war effort during World War II by doing more than just using her fame and physical beauty to sell war bonds and entertaining the troops at the Hollywood Canteen. In her spare time, she thought about torpedoes: powerful, yet hard to control weapons which might hit their targets more precisely when guided by radio signals. Lamarr knew that the problem with radio signals was that they could easily be jammed by the enemy \u2013 and with her co-inventor, pianist and composer George Antheil, she developed a \u201cSecret Communication System\u201d based on the idea of having radio signals hop around frequencies in a seemingly random pattern, making it thereby hard to impossible to interfere with them. A patent was granted to Lamarr and Antheil, but the United States Navy dismissed the technology, in part due to the fact that it had been proposed by an actress and a composer. Lamarr's idea of frequency hopping remained untouched until the 1960s, when the Navy first used it in a buoy signaling submarine locations to airplanes during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the following decades, the military and private companies developed numerous technologies around the idea of frequency hopping, which is found in most digital devices communicating wirelessly today, be it via bluetooth, WiFi, or in cell phones. Hedy Lamarr's legacy, though, remained that of a beautiful Hollywood actress and sex symbol until recently. Only in 2014 were she and Antheil inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\n\nAdmittedly, Lamarr was not the first person to think of frequency hopping as a method for making radio signals harder to intercept and jam: none other than Nikola Tesla was granted a U.S. patent in 1903 which does not use the words \u201cfrequency hopping\u201d, but describes changing wireless frequencies to avoid interception of radio communication. During World War I, the German army used a primitive way of frequency hopping to stop the British listening in to their radio communication. It may be an overstatement, therefore, to say that without Hedy Lamarr there would be no bluetooth, no WiFi, no cell phones today. But she did invent a unique way of doing frequency hopping, and many recent patents in frequency hopping spread spectrum technology refer to the Lamarr-Antheil patent as the basis of the field.\n\nWhen it comes to Hedy Lamarr, although she resented not being credited for her scientific inventions for most of her life and instead being reduced to a beautiful face and body, she was after all a woman of her (sexist) time: during her later years, she desperately tried to save her looks through multiple plastic surgery, comically distorting her face to the point where she hardly left the house any more and could only be reached by phone. When, in 1997, her work was finally credited for the first time with the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s Pioneer Award, 82-year-old Hedy sent a recorded message: \u201cIn acknowledgement of your honoring me, I hope you feel good as well as I feel good about it, and it was not done in vain. Thank you.\u201d\n\nSources:\nBarton, Ruth. Hedy Lamarr: The most beautiful woman in film. Lexington, Ky.: University Press of Kentucky, 2010.\nF\u00f6rster, Jochen, and Anthony Loder.

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "For the past three years we studied the world\u2019s largest 3D printing community \u201cThingiverse\u201d. We explored the remix-relationships\u2014accessible due the community\u2019s use of open licenses\u2014of more than 200.000 individual designs, tracked an entire week\u2019s new designs for half a year, interviewed more than 80 creators and surveyed over 200 more. This allowed us to develop a deep understanding of the creative processes that take place on the platform.\nIn this talk we would like to present our findings. This is of interest to people who care about 3D printing as we can give sort of a behind the scenes view on how ideas come to life here. But it is also interesting to people that care about creativity in general. As what we have found has merit outside of 3D printing, too. In this talk we would like to cover the following: (1) Introduce our research setting and explain why it is useful to study this, (2) provide a consolidated overview on our most interesting findings, and (3) give real life examples for how these findings are transferable to other settings.\nWe have presented primary results of the studies at various academic conferences and have a comprehensive paper on the project currently under revision at the Journal of Information Technology (see attached file). We are a group of three university professors and a Ph.D. student. We work on the intersection of information systems, innovation management, product development, and creativity. We believe that many of the people we studied either attend 33C3 or watch talks online and we therefore think that our results would be of interest to this community. Further, we feel that a well structured talk is better and more entertaining than mailing around our academic journal publications to those who are interested. And lastly, we are eager to receive feedback from a more hands-on audience (than what we deal with at academic conferences). It would be especially useful for us to hear of new developments, discuss ideas for follow-up research projects, and get access to creators that would like to work with us in the future.",
        "description": "When we think about creativity we imagine some lone genius that has an incredible insight. Oftentimes, this understanding goes hand in hand with some form of divine intervention: someone is \u201cblessed\u201d, or literally \u201ctouched by the Gods\u201d. When we look at academic research that deals with creativity we see a fundamentally different picture. Creative insights are no divine interventions, they are almost always recombinations of known building blocks, they are what is now often called \u201cremixes\u201d. For a long time scholars have tried to make these remixes visible. However, this turned out to be pretty complicated. Creatives either do not want to name their sources of inspiration (for instance due to copyright infringements) or they do not exactly recall what inspired them. For the last three years we looked at creators from the realm of 3D printing. On the world\u2019s largest platform for 3D printable designs (Thingiverse) creators are allowed to remix existing designs but in turn have to indicate which designs they used. This open licensing allowed us to study remix relationships across the entire platform. We explored the remix-relationships\u2014accessible due to their use of open licenses\u2014of more than 200.000 individual designs, tracked an entire week\u2019s new designs for half a year, interviewed more than 80 creators and surveyed over 200 more. On the foundation of these empirical observations, we studied the creative processes in regards to four dimensions: (i) the role of remixes in creative communities, (ii) the different patterns of remixing processes, (iii) the surrounding features that facilitate remixes, and (iv) the characteristics of the remixing users. What we found has merit outside of 3D printing as the creative behaviors that we were able to study are transferable to other settings. In this talk we would like to provide an entertaining overview on our finding, provide examples from 3D printing and contrast them to other creative behaviors. We have attached a working paper that is currently under revision at the Journal of Information Technology. This paper will provide more detail on what we did methodologically. It also entails a couple of figures that illustrate both research setting and findings well. Our research is exploratory in nature. That means we did not start with a clear set of hypotheses like many research projects do. Such a form of research is typical if you want to understand \nmore about an under-researched phenomenon. In our case we wanted to find out how remixing in a digital setting works, and how important it is for creative communities. After studying the setting we conclude our research with five propositions. These are basically guidelines that sum up our findings. These five are: (P1) Remixes pose a major source of innovation in open online communities besides the emergence of isolated designs. (P2) Remixes occur in the form of several different, clearly distinguishable evolutionary paths including convergent and divergent patterns. (P3) The co-existence of different design categories allows for cross-category remixes, which are asymmetric with categories tending to either donate or absorb ideas. (P4) The effectiveness of remixing in online platforms and their attractiveness to different user groups is influenced by a variety of platform features for browsing and processing its contents. (P5) To foster innovation in online communities, platforms need to address the needs and interests of different user groups, each characterized by distinct preferences regarding platform features. Overall we were struck by how important remixing is for the creative process we see in the 3D printing community. And we hope that our research will on the one hand provide more creatives with and understanding how others come to solutions and on the other hand ignite a discussion on the importance of remixing for creative processes in general. More research on this is needed and also platforms need to address this aspect of creativity better.",

This talk will give you an overview of the thirty years of history behind PUFs, and will include the most recent advances in research.

        "description": "What do CPU registers, sticks of RAM, shared memory in GPUs, and paper have in common? They all have unique properties that are impossible[1] to reproduce, even when using the same manufacturing process. These properties can be turned into physically unclonable functions, or PUFs for short, yielding an object-bound unique identifier. This makes you trackable, but since you're being tracked anyway, you might as well put some of this to good use.\n\nThe idea of PUFs is not new, and can be traced back several decades to anti-counterfeiting measures in currency. Since then, several formalizations have been proposed, new types of PUFs have been invented, implemented, attacked, and scrutinized. PUFs can be used to identify and authenticate devices. They can be used to secure your boot process. Some PUF constructions can be used to enhance your random number generation. You might be using devices right now that have properties that can be turned into PUFs, provided you have the tools and want to do some programming.\n\nThis talk will take you on a brief tour of the history of PUFs. Along the way, it will show you how a PUF is constructed, what its properties should be, what it can be used for, what materials and devices are known to be suitable for building one, and how you might go about searching for them in your own devices.\n\n[1] For certain definitions of impossible.",

It is arguably the first serious attempt to establish this extension, in the form of its own blockchain, beyond the form of an academic proposal. The talk provides an introduction to the magic that makes it work.",
        "description": "Despite everything, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency has not imploded or destroyed itself; it might be here to stay after all. That would presently include, however, its biggest flaw: The utter lack of anonymity. In fact, the famed Bitcoin blockchain is the world's most robust, transparent, and <em>public</em> financial accounting system ever.\n\nThe above means that Bitcoin's potential widespread adoption is nothing short of a privacy horror scenario straight out of Orwell. Every toilet paper purchase publicly recorded, verified, stamped, and approved. This should not be news to anyone.\n\nIn 2013, a few reputable cryptographers came up with some mathematical magic that would, if integrated into Bitcoin, enable anonymous transactions. This proposal has been described in an academic paper under the name Zerocoin and a year later improved in another paper under the name Zerocash. The plan had then shifted to establishing the system as an anonymous <em>altcoin</em> rather than to push for integration into Bitcoin itself. Zcash is the name of a company formed by the authors of Zerocash to develop and launch this altcoin; launch occured as planned on 28 October 2016.\n\nThis talk will introduce the audience to the mathematical and technical background of Zcash, and report on the state of the currency two months after its launch. A degree in mathematics is not required.\n\nNote: The presenter is not affiliated with the Zcash company.",

In this presentation, we not only describe the details of\nthe flaw but, based on our research, explain why the current state of\nPRNG implementation and quality assurance downright provokes incidents.\nWe also present a PRNG analysis method that we developed and give\nspecific recommendations to implementors of software producing or\nconsuming pseudo-random numbers to ensure correctness.\n",

His Drone Shadow installations have appeared on city streets worldwide, he has mapped deportation centres with CGI, designed new kinds of citizenship based on online behaviour. and used neural networks and satellite images to predict election results. A New Dark Age is an exploration of what we can no longer know about the world, and what we can do about it.\n\n",
        "description": "The history of computation and the history of the weather are deeply intertwined. The possibilities of mathematical prediction have driven a belief in our ability to model and control the world. Today, the pervasive metaphor of \"the Cloud\" shapes how we think about the world - but not always in useful or democratic ways. James Bridle's Cloud Index explored this history and sets out a new model for thinking about the world with the cloud at its heart: a nebulous, ever-changing set of possibilities, founded on unknowing.\n\nThe Cloud Index (http://cloudindx.com, 2016) is an online artwork using neural networks to generate new weather patterns corresponding to differing electoral outcomes. The work challenges our ability to predict and thus control the future, and questions our intentions and ethics when it comes to the things we build.\n\nUsing the Cloud Index as a starting point, Bridle's lecture explores the military and political histories of computation, networking, and weather control. As the processes of computational thinking - the belief that the gathering of ever-increasing volumes of data and the application of vast engines of computing power - fail to produce coherence or agency in the world, Bridle suggests that we should take the Cloud at its word. Cloud thinking is the acknowledgement that we cannot know or predict everything, and our technology is trying to teach us a different way of seeing and understanding the world.",

While many people are aware of the need for renewable energy, electric vehicles and more efficient homes and manufacturing, fewer people are aware that animal agriculture is a major issue which must be addressed.  In fact animal agriculture is one of the highest impact human activities, producing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental damage on par with worldwide transportation and industrial manufacturing.\n  Rather than convincing people to give up animal products, some groups (academic, industrial and biohackers) are using science to produce near-identical, or in some cases identical, replacements for these products.  Replacing animal products will greatly reduce the environmental impact of our diets, without making people give up the food they desire.\n  I will discuss various approaches including plant protein databases used for engineering realistic animal product replacement, production of proteins in genetically modified microorganisms, and culturing of animal cells without the growing of a whole animal.  The science behind these approaches, potential impact, and progress by various players in these fields will be presented.  Finally I give a progress update on the Real Vegan Cheese project, which is run out of biohacker spaces in the SF bay area and aims to produce real cheese from engineered yeast.",

There is a cross-vm data leak attack, a cross-vm data write attack, and an in-sandbox (MS Edge) Javascript data leak + full memory read/write attack based in MS Edge.\n\nIn this talk we detail how memory deduplication works and the many different ways it is exploited in our attacks.",
        "description": "Memory deduplication is a widely applied technique to reduce memory consumption in servers, VM hosts, desktop systems and even mobile devices. Deduplication maps multiple identical copies of a physical page onto a single shared copy with copy-on-write semantics. As a result, a write to such a shared page triggers a page fault and is thus measurably slower than a write to a unshared page. Prior work has shown that an attacker able to craft pages on the target system can use this timing difference as a simple single-bit side channel to discover that certain pages exist in the system.\n\nIn this talk, we show that the security implications of using memory deduplication are much more severe than initially assumed. We show that by maliciously programming memory deduplication, an attacker can build primitives to read arbitrary data from memory and even write to memory in a limited but powerful way. We exemplify these primitives using three attacks that we have recently developed.\n\nThe first attack, CAIN, uses memory deduplication to brute-force ASLR\u2019s entropy bits from a co-hosted victim VM. The second attack, Dedup Est Machina, extends CAIN in order to leak arbitrary data such as ASLR heap/code pointers and password hashes in a victim\u2019s browser from JavaScript. Using the leaked pointers, Dedup Est Machina uses a Rowhammer exploit to own Microsoft Edge without relying on a single software vulnerability. The third attack, Flip Feng Shui, uses memory deduplication to control the placement of a co-hosted victim VM\u2019s sensitive information on physical memory for building a sophisticated Rowhammer attack on RSA public keys. Flip Feng Shui makes cross-VM Rowhammer attacks precise, fast and reliable. As an example, Flip Feng Shui compromises the OpenSSH server of a victim VM in less than 10 minutes in 84% of the cases.\n\nWe conclude memory deduplication is fatal for security in more ways than one.\n\nSpeaker BIOs:\n\n\nKaveh\nKaveh Razavi is a security researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "Input/Output is the mechanisms through which embedded systems interact and control the outside world. Particularly when employed in mission critical systems, the I/O of embedded systems has to be both reliable and secure. Embedded system\u2019s I/O is controlled by a pin based approach. In this work, we investigate the security implications of embedded system\u2019s pin control. In particular, we show how an attacker can tamper with the integrity and availability of an embedded system\u2019s I/O by exploiting cerain pin control operations and the lack of hardware interrupts associated to them. ",
        "description": "Embedded systems are widely used today in a variety of applications, such as consumer, industrial, automotive, medical, commercial and military. As such, they are often employed in mission critical systems that have to be both reliable and secure. In particular, it is important that their I/O (Input/Output) be stable and secure, as this is the way they interact with the outside world. \n\nDigging into their architecture, we know that the I/O interfaces of embedded systems (e.g., GPIO, SCI, USB, etc.), are usually controlled by a so-called System on a Chip (SoC), an integrated circuit that combines multiple I/O interfaces. In turn, the pins in a SoC are managed by a pin controller, a subsystem of SoC, through which one can configure pin multiplexing or the input or output mode of pins. One of the most peculiar aspects of a pin controller is that its behavior is determined by a set of registers: by altering these registers one can change the behavior of the chip in a dramatic way. This feature is exploitable by attackers, who can tamper with the integrity or the availability of legitimate I/O operations, factually changing how an embedded system interacts with the outside world. Based on these observations, in this research, we introduce a novel attack technique against embedded systems, which we call pin control attack. As we will demonstrate in the work, the salient features of this new class of attacks are:\nFirst, it is intrinsically stealth. The alteration of the pin configuration does not generate any interrupt, preventing the OS to react to it.\n\nSecondly, it is entirely different in execution from traditional techniques such as manipulation of kernel data structures or system call hooking, which are typically monitored by anti-rootkit protection systems.\nFinally, it is viable. It is possible to build concrete attack using it.\nTo demonstrate these points, we first present and demonstrate the attack capabilities offered by Pin Control attack, together with the minimal requirements for carrying out the attack. We argue that the attack capabilities include blocking the communication with a peripheral, causing physical damage to the peripheral, and manipulating values read or written by legitimate processes. We show how pin control can be exploited both with and without the attacker having kernel-level or root access.\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of our attack technique, we describe the practical implementation of an attack against a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) environment by exploiting the runtime configuration of the I/O pins used by the PLC to control a physical process. The attack allows one to reliably take control of the physical process normally managed by the PLC, while remaining stealth to both the PLC runtime and operators monitoring the process through a Human Machine Interface, a goal much more challenging than simply disabling the process control capabilities of the PLC, which would anyway lead to potentially catastrophic consequences. The attack does not require modification of the PLC logic or traditional kernel tampering or hooking techniques, which are normally monitored by anti-rootkit tools.\nWe present two variations of the attack implementation. The first implementation allows an extremely reliable manipulation of the process at the cost of requiring root access. The second implementation slightly relaxes the requirement of reliable manipulation while allowing the manipulation to be achieved without root access.\nFinally, we discuss potential mechanisms to detect/prevent Pin Configuration exploitation. However, because the pin configuration does happen legitimately at runtime and the lack of proper interrupt notifications from the SoC, it seems non-trivial to devise monitoring techniques that are both reliable and sufficiently light way to be employed in embedded systems.\n",

        "abstract": "In the last two years, the marketing industry started to show a fast increasing interest in technologies for user cross-device tracking, proximity tracking, and their derivative monetization schemes. To meet these demands, a new ultrasound-based technology has recently emerged and is already utilized in a number of different real-world applications. Ultrasound tracking comes with a number of desirable features (e.g., easy to deploy, inaudible to humans), but alarmingly until now no comprehensive security analysis of the technology has been conducted. In this talk, we will publish the results of our security analysis of the ultrasound tracking ecosystem, and demonstrate the practical security and privacy risks that arise with its adoption. Subsequently, we will introduce some immediately deployable defense mechanisms for practitioners, researchers, and everyday users. Finally, we will initiate the discussion for the standardization of ultrasound beacons, and outline our proposed OS-level API that enables both secure and effortless deployment for ultrasound-enabled applications.",
        "description": "This talk will present the outcomes of the first comprehensive security study on the ultrasound tracking ecosystem.\n \nThis ecosystem remained almost unknown to the general public until recently, when a newly-founded company faced the nemesis of the security community and the regulators (e.g., the Federal Trade Commission) for its controversial tracking techniques. However, there are many more \u201ctraditional players\u201d using ultrasound tracking techniques for various purposes, raising a number of levels of security and privacy issues with different security and privacy models.\n \nIn general, the main advantage of the ultrasound technology compared to already existing solutions is that it does not require any specialized equipment (unlike wifi and bluetooth), while it remains inaudible to humans.  For this reason, the technology is already utilized in a number of different real-world applications, such as device pairing, proximity detection, and cross-device tracking. From a technical perspective, ultrasound tracking is based an ecosystem featuring multiple participating entities (e.g., the users, the advertisers, the content providers, the tracking provider).\n \nIn this talk, we will present the first comprehensive and in-depth security analysis of ultrasound tracking technology and the surrounding ecosystem. More specifically, we will provide visibility within the ecosystem\u2019s walled garden, examine the different facets of the ultrasound technology, explain how it is currently used in the real world, and subsequently evaluate the privacy and security of the technology itself and the existing deployments.\n \nBased on our findings, we will then introduce a new class of attacks against ultrasound tracking mechanisms, along with analysis of real-world Android apps featuring ultrasound frameworks. In particular, we will show how an ultrasound cross-device tracking framework can be abused to perform stealthy de-anonymization attacks (e.g., to unmask users who browse the Internet through anonymity networks such as Tor), to inject fake or spoofed audio beacons, and to leak users\u2019 private information.\n \nIn the mitigation part of our talk, we will outline immediately deployable defenses that empower practitioners, researchers, and everyday users to protect their privacy. In particular, we will release a browser extension and an Android permission module that enable users to selectively suppress frequencies falling within the ultrasonic spectrum.\n\nIn the last part of our talk, we would like to engage in discussion with the audience regarding the  standardization of ultrasound beacons, and share our design of a flexible OS-level API that addresses both the effortless deployment of ultrasound-enabled applications and the existing privacy and security problems.\n",

The title derives from a social network induced anxiety condition. One brought on by trying to keep up with a rapidly moving world. A fear of constantly being one-step behind, in the wrong place, and missing out on the most exciting events. The Fear Of Missing Out proposes that it is possible to be one step ahead of the art world by using well-crafted algorithms and computational logic.\n\nThe works in the show are the result of a computer algorithm written by Lund. By analysing and categorizing a wide range of artworks, by the most successful contemporary artists, a set of instructions were generated explaining, step by step, how to make the most successful works of art. The artist then simply made the work following the instructions. In The Fear of Missing Out, important categories from the art world such as authenticity, artistry, talent, and creativity are questioned. The title also refers to the urge to be a part of a transparent information society made up of an overarching digital network.\n\nFlip City\nhttp://jonaslund.biz/works/flip-city/\nSteve Turner Contemporary is pleased to present Flip City, a solo exhibition by Amsterdam-based artist Jonas Lund, who will present a group of paintings that are inspired by the current appetite for process-based abstraction; the related trend of collectors/investors buying such works to flip them quickly for a profit; and the central role that Los Angeles has played in both realms.\n\nFor Flip City, Lund will create forty digital paintings, of which a selection will be on view during the run of the exhibition and the others will be presented at art fairs in Europe, Latin America and the United States during the next twelve months. Each work has elements sampled from paintings by other emerging artists, yet Lund\u2019s works are so thoroughly remixed that only a very astute observer might see familiar passages. Lund will install a GPS tracking device on the stretcher bar of each painting so that he can track its movements and approximate whereabouts. He will also maintain a website with this information in the years to come.\n\nSTRINGS ATTACHED\nhttp://jonaslund.biz/works/strings-attached/\n\nSteve Turner is pleased to present Strings Attached, a solo exhibition by Amsterdam-based artist Jonas Lund which will feature 24 text-based paintings that relate to the current \u201cbubble moment\u201d in contemporary art. Each work uses text that restricts the transfer of ownership in some way, such as \u201cThis painting may never be sold at auction\u201d or \u201cThis painting must be resold by March 21, 2017.\u201d Lund uses fabric wallpaper as backgrounds for the works, and their messages have been painted by a sign painter according to Lund\u2019s directions. As a group, the 24 paintings encompass contradictory efforts made by gallerists who both want to fuel market momentum for their artists while trying to shield them from the damaging effects of quick-profit speculation.\n",

(What if ethics were about natural language processing?)\n\nBased on ongoing research about the development of artifical intelligence in the driverless car, this talk describes how \u201eethics\u201c is being deployed to shape the idea of accountability in the context of the law and insurance; it is presented as a problem to be solved by software; it is an imagined space of \u201ecybernetic success\u201c; and it is a proxy vocabulary for the relationship between humans and machines working together. This talk is about how the emergence of this new technology is reshaping what ethics means in a data society. ",

        "subtitle": "Why Censorship is a Bad Idea for Everyone",
        "abstract": "Internet censorship today is widespread, both by governments and by private entities. Much of the discussion so far has focused on political and social effects of this censorship. However, censorship also has a clear effect on the economic structure of society that has not been explored.",
        "description": "When censorship increases the cost of information, it also increases the cost of doing business as a whole. At the same time, however, censorship can also serve as protectionism. How large and pervasive the impact on an economic system is, is difficult to gauge. Even more so, getting reliable information about censorship and its economic effects is a real challenge.\n\nThis talk seeking to establish a link between censorship and economic performance and is based on my PhD project in Economics at the University of Duisburg-Essen.\nCensorship is \u201cthe control of the information and ideas circulated within a society\u201d. Governments have tried to control information for as long as they have existed, but new technologies have changed censorship significantly. Internet censorship today is widespread. Governments and companies differ in both the extent of their censorship and the technical implementation. I conceptualize censorship as falling on a continuum between the theoretical ideal state of \u201cno censorship\u201d, most closely approximated by Iceland (Freedom on the Net 2014) and pervasive censorship and isolation, like in North Korea. \n\nIn the series of papers I am currently writing as part of my PhD in Economics, I focus on both theoretical arguments on the possible costs (and benefits?) of censorship for economies, and try to construct a reliable estimate. Having a background in China was a main motivation for this project, as censorship is so wide-spread there. The US has recently dubbed \u201cThe Great Firewall\u201d protectionism, but did not further elucidate what is meant by this. \n\nThe economic effects of internet censorship have not been studied comprehensively yet. However, with our move towards an information society, and the rise of an \u201cinternet industry\u201d, censorship is clearly becoming more important. We see censorship shaping entire industries in countries like China, where the government outsourced some of its censorship activities to select firms. Even beyond extreme examples of censorship like China, the impact on economic activities in a society seems self-evident. \n\nIn this talk, I touch on the theoreotical model I am developing, and try to estimate the economic effects of censorship. In doing so, I also try to understand which forms of censorship are most costly for an economy. I believe that societies currently loose a lot of economic welfare through censorship, in addition to the social and political costs that have been focused on previously. In addition, I focus on the difficulties in obtaining data for such a politically-sensitive topic.",

        "description": "Just as 18th century priests enforced total surveillance measures on masturbators, the new priests of the digital age are listening to your confessions and forcing you into puritanical repentance.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t have a relative, a friend, a colleague, who broke up because of an iMessage showing up on the wrong device, fooled by the iCloud, by a suspicious Facebook like, or a Pokemon caught in the wrong neighborhood? \n\nI want to make the claim that a new system of surveillance, organized by the new priests of our digital age, are slyly acting behind our back to make us conform to a new form of puritan morality.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, masturbation suddenly became a topic of intense reflection. In the Enlightenment Encyclopedia it is described as the new disease of a wounded conscience and a heinous sin. Surprisingly, the Christian Church was not responsible. It had, until then, never regarded masturbation as anything other than a marginal problem for adult men (and especially monks). \n\nThe people responsible for making masturbation a sin were economists, who worried about the consequences of masturbation for productivity in an economy that depended on the endless desire for more. The condemnation of masturbation spread, and in no time, doctors were making scientific claims to prove the dangers of masturbation, while priests made it their new obsession. \n\nIn the confessional, the sinners had to avow everything, not only their reprehensible actions, but their reprehensible dreams, the languorous images that crossed their consciousness, the birth of desire in their troubled mind. The priests demanded to know it all, the most inner thoughts of the masturbators. The sinner was meant to keep his own mind under surveillance.\n\nToday, we believe that we have overcome this obscure period. Masturbation is widely accepted as a healthy sexual practice. But most importantly, our liberal democracies strongly posit that public ethics should remain neutral regarding sexuality, and that each one of us is free to have the sexuality that we prefer, enjoy, and that no institution is authorized to morally judge us for our sexual activities. \n\nYet, I want to make the claim that a new system of surveillance, organized by the new priests of our digital age, are slyly acting behind our back to make us conform to a new form of puritan morality. Just as the 18th century priests did in their Churches, the high priests of the digital age listen to our confessions, record them, and eventually make us repent. \n \nWho doesn\u2019t have a relative, a friend, a colleague, who broke up because of an iMessage showing up on the wrong device, fooled by the iCloud, by a suspicious Facebook like, or a Pokemon caught in the wrong neighborhood? \n\nThe economic interests of having us behave morally are numerous: the best customer is predictable, and who is more predictable than an obedient child, or a pious wife or husband? From the pithy history of masturbation to real life break-ups, I will demonstrate the dark connections between digital surveillance, neoliberal economics and morality. \n\nI am a researcher at Columbia University and Sciences Po Paris in political philosophy. I am an expert of the Snowden case and digital surveillance. This will be my first talk on masturbation. ",

        "abstract": "The genome \u2013 the final frontier \u2013 or just a complex mess of letters? Somewhere in there, our eye or skin color is hidden. But also, diseases can be diagnosed or predicted by analyzing the genome. More and more research is committed to finding clues for diseases in our genes. The opportunity is clear: If I know about a disease I might get ahead of time, I could possibly intervene before it starts. Yet: How accurate are these predictions and how meaningful are they? And more importantly: What happens to my genetic data once it has been decoded?",
        "description": "Genetic data is quite valuable, but not just for researchers, but also for health insurances, other insurers, law enforcement and employers. However, that genomic data can always be re-identified, since it is a unique pattern. Therefore, genomic data needs to be secured.\nIn my talk, I would like to point out the possibilities which have arisen by whole genome sequencing, that is the complete decoding and analysis of one person\u2019s genome. This milestone of biological research is important for medical advances such as personalized medicine. But it is also subject to commercialization. For ever more decreasing prices, one person can easily sequence their own genome and get access to information on heritage and possible risks of genetic diseases. This means that private companies are accumulating massive amounts of whole genome data. Additionally, third parties could send in probes of other people, which they can get quite easily. But how do we interpret the data? Even though people tend to believe that the genome holds many answers to diseases and risks, this has been a misconception. For most diseases, the environment, lifestyle and maybe even just bad luck play a much more important role.\nStill, many researchers are trying to analyze more and more genomes, especially in cancer research. Genetic predispositions for cancer are usually quite small probabilities, so a large sample size is needed to get reliable results. The limitless demand for more data is problematic on its own; however, getting informed consent from donors is also a problem. Once sequenced, one whole genome sequence can be about 150GB in size, which causes problems for transmitting and analyzing it. Today, genomes are shared via cloud or, interestingly, on hard drives via post. But international exchange of data also means that different legal and data security standards are mixed.\nWhole Genome Sequencing provides us with opportunities for medical and biological science, but with challenges in ethics and privacy.

        "description": "The Nintendo Game Boy was an 8-bit handheld gaming console that competed with the SEGA Game Gear and the Atari Lynx. Compared to its competition, it had very little RAM (8 KB) and no color support (4 shades of gray at 160x144). It was succeeded by the Game Boy Color, which fixed this main shortcoming, but shared the same architecture. During the 14 year life span of the 8 bit Game Boy platform, game programmers kept understanding the hardware better and better, and continued finding new tricks for better graphics effects, such as sprite multiplexing, parallax and palette effects. This talk explains all the hardware details of the Game Boy: The programming model of the 8080/Z80-like LR35902 CPU, the system's sound, timer and I/O functionality, and programming details as well as common tricks involving the graphics processor (\"PPU\"), which was specifically designed for LCD output. The listener will get a good understanding of 8 bit programming and creative programming on extremely limited hardware, as well as common tricks that can be generalized to other systems.",

        "description": "Sharing experiences and knowledge have always been essential for human development. They enable skill transfers and empathy. Over history, mankind developed from oral traditions to cultures of writing. With the ongoing digital revolution, the hurdles to share knowledge and experiences vanish.  Already today it is, for example, technically feasible to take and store 24/7 video recordings of one's\u2019 life. While this example creates massive collections of data, it makes it even more challenging to share experiences and knowledge with others in meaningful ways.\n\nA recurring theme in science fiction literature is the download of the abilities of another human to one's mind. Although current cognitive science and neuroscience strongly suggest that this is impossible, as our minds are embodied; we believe that skill transfer and effective learning will accelerate tremendously given recent technological trends; just to name a few of the enabling technologies, human augmentation using virtual/augmented reality, new sensing modalities (e.g. affective computing) and actuation (e.g. haptics), advances in immersive storytelling (increasing empathy, immersion, communication)  etc. \n\nThe talk starts with sensing and actuation technology, giving an overview about them and discussing how they can be used.\n\nI\u2019m discussing several novel upcoming sensing modalities for VR and AR, first of all eye movement analysis for interaction and activity recognition, introducing the pupil eye tracker (open source eye tracker from pupil labs), affective wear (one of our research to track facial expressions on affordable smart glasses) to J!NS MEME (EOG glasses that can detect how much you are reading and how attentive you are). \n\nIn the next part of the talk I go into details about actuation.Here I especially discuss haptics.\nFrom the TECHTILE Toolkit (a rapid prototyping haptic toolkit from two of my colleagues Kouta Minamizawa and Masashi Nakatani) to the REZ Infinite Haptic Suit.\n\nIn the end, I give an outlook on projects that push the limits for experience sharing and skill transfer: the Swiss Cybathlon and the Japanese Super Human Sports Society.\n\n\nI\u2019m a researcher in the wearable computing, AR and VR field organizing a Dagstuhl Seminar on a similar topic, I\u2019m also a founding member of the Japanese Super Human Sports Society.",

        "subtitle": "Towards A Global Network Of Neighbourhoods And Cities Rejecting Surveillance",
        "abstract": "Cities are emerging as a space for local action and local change but also as dangerous spaces where social engineering, exclusion by design and privatised policing take place rapidly, without adequate frames to catch up and assure fundamental rights. Is the city the answer to a new digital ecosystem, with effective mechanisms to enforce it, in the local government powers?",
        "description": "Sophisticated surveillance systems are approved by, funded by and deployed by local authorities, Cities are emerging as the spaces where everything is controlled by invisible technology, almost imperceptible in daily life. Those surveillance cameras now visible on street corners are replaced by systems of constant monitoring integrated in the landscape. Cities of sensors collecting our data all day long, where each movement is registered and stored, where decisions are automated and dehumanised. Monetised to optimise consumption, predict behaviour. Control people and the local and micro local level. \n\nBut cities are also the spaces where a different form of politics is emerging, from Rome to Barcelona, from Madrid to Paris, citizens are taking back the domestic infrastructure. Is there the answer for digital sovereignty?\n\nToday, cities of sensors collecting our data all day long, where each movement is registered and stored, where decisions are automated and dehumanised. Monetised to optimise consumption, predict behaviour. Control people. The benefits of not knowing who decides and why, stand to be gained by the same conglomerate who bets on this vision. A few companies developing software, hardware and capacities in countries that can be counted on one hand. A market of US$8 billion, which is expected to grow tenfold by the year 2020. \n\nAlthough discourses keep feeding the imaginary, descriptions of cameras detecting pickpockets, this is something radically different. Matrices that combine lots of data in real-time. This vision for the city of the future, promoted by a small group of technology conglomerates, is one where quality of life is directly proportional to the predictability and homogeneity of its inhabitants, clashing with the struggle for diversity and diverse behaviors. To achieve this vision, much more is sacrificed than privacy. We pawn off our security to those in the sealed-off control room. It is to sacrifice the purest form of democracy we have, our right to protest freely and anonymously in the town square.\n\nThe talk will explore how local surveillance systems are rapidly expanding across Latin America and Asia. Much earlier and faster than the regulatory frameworks for adequate protection of privacy and personal data. Without democratic mechanisms, community or neighbourhood consultations to determine their necessity or appropriateness. \n\nThe talk will also look into the public policy and budgetary implications of the surveillance city, when contracts that are signed tie the hands of more than one public institution, borrowing from future municipal budgets, with a coordinated marketing and data machinery that does not offer solid evidence to prove effectiveness. Public authorities assure us that cameras, scenario modelling and mass surveillance will eliminate the problem of insecurity, advancing these over other public policies meant to attack extreme poverty and inequality of access to basic services, as well as the recovery of public space. The studies that vouch for the effectiveness of surveillance as a crime reduction measure are incomplete; they do not take local internal and external factors into account, and cannot be applied to different contexts.\n\nThe talk will also look into current efforts to reverse the smart city model into a humane city and how the local power could be the formula to challenge the surveillance space and take back our fundamental rights.",

I will also show some of my personal works in this field, ranging from passive radio antenna stations towards universal modems to transform existing conductive architecture into a computer network.\n\nAs a hybrid between computer scientist and media artist, I am creating works at the intersection of engineering, sculpture and formal aesthetics, which investigate power relations between citizens and technology, and often also the relations between citizens and the state. In my latest works, I am pondering how technology can be capable of re-democratizing public space, and how the issues surrounding the creation of private spaces through technological means can be artistically addressed.

How can a liberal state dedicated to upholding individual liberty interfere in technological progress, and why should it? ",
        "description": "Do we really want to leave our technological futures in the hands of the major AI researchers \u2013 Google, Facebook, and the US Defense Department? \n\nI argue that our political system is designed not to deal with the questions raised by the transhumanist movement, and that without a major overhaul of political liberalism, technological progress will escape democratic oversight.\n\nFor the first time in history we have the ability to choose what it means to be human, and yet our liberal pluralist societies preclude substantive debate about our collective future. Modern liberal states are based upon the assumption that there is no single best way to live, and that for the state to endorse a substantive vision of the good life is to open the door to totalitarianism. On matters of personal conviction \u2013 human nature, our place in the cosmos, and our ultimate goals \u2013 liberal states want us to agree to disagree. \n\nHowever, we cannot simply agree to disagree about transhumanism because our individual choices will affect the entire species. If you decide to upload your brain onto a computer and abandon your biological body, you are choosing what is essential to humanity: you are defining human nature. If, on the other hand, the government bans technological enhancement, it is also imposing a vision of humanity. Thus, only once liberalism abandons the pretense of neutrality can we start imagining alternative technological futures and debating the underlying vision of the good life that will orient our choice.\n\nI\u2019m a political theory researcher at Sciences Po, and this talk draws on modern political theories of liberalism, the latest transhumanist literature, and ancient Greek theories of the good life.",

At the same time, a proper form of oversight is all but missing. Other countries such as China have even defended their own terrorism bills pointing at this very piece of legislation.\n\nAmid loud privacy and civil right concerns, the Bill has already passed the House of Commons where only 5\u00a0% of casted votes opposed it.\n\nBut, does this reflect the will of the electorate? Is this the lesson from the Snowden revelations that we are going to see more not less infringements on civil rights?\n\nThe talk will also answer the question how the bill\u2019s provisions compare to other initiatives like the new BND law in Germany or the Patriot Act in the USA.",

        "description": "The GFW's reactive probing system scans egress network traffic for circumvention protocol signatures, and then launches short-lived probes to verify if the suspected server is, in fact, speaking the circumvention protocol. If that is the case, the GFW adds the IP address and port of the server to a country-wide blacklist, preventing people in China from connecting to it. We recently finished a multi-month research project in which we looked at the system from different angles to answer several open questions. In particular, we will talk about:\n<ul>\n<li>How the reactive probing system makes use of thousands of unique IP addresses to launch its probes.</li>\n<li>We discuss our hypotheses on the physical design of the reactive probing system. Our evidence shows that all these IP addresses are either hijacked, or that the GFW operates a large, geographically distributed network of proxies.</li>\n<li>We show patterns in the IP, TCP, and TLS headers that suggest that the thousands of reactive probing IP addresses we harvested are controlled by few centralized systems.</li>\n<li>How the system seems to flush its blacklist regularly, providing a short window for circumvention.</li>\n<li>The effectiveness of the system, i.e., how good is it at blocking servers and how well does it scale?</li>\n<li>How the GFW seems to treat science and education networks different from consumer networks.</li>\n<li>Ways to troll the Great Firewall of China.</li>\n</ul>",

But research about these projects and how they work generally doesn't take into account the value of anonymous participation.\n\n Moderating user-generated or peer-produced content has challenges and many services (Yelp, Google, Wikipedia, Cloudflare, etc) have turned to third party blacklists, real-name policies, and banning users of anonymity networks like Tor to handle real and perceived abuse issues.\nThe result of such decisions in aggregate means that the Internet offers uneven opportunities for participation and engagement.  It\u2019s easy to imagine anonymous participants as only jerks and trolls, but much harder to quantify the contributions that don\u2019t happen when anonymity is banned or made more difficult.\n\nWe interviewed Tor users about their participation in peer production projects and Wikipedia editors about their privacy concerns. In this talk, we will share stories about the contributions of anonymous participants and the chilling effects of limiting anonymity ---topics not edited and people silenced.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, NGOs have been struggling to defend civil rights in Brussels. As human rights defenders, it is part of our job to detect failures in the EU\u2019s digital policy-making. But we rarely have the opportunity to explore the underlying reasons and to debug Europe\u2019s kernel package.",
        "description": "In this talk, we want to analyse the EU\u2019s biggest fails and explore the following questions: Where and why is the European Union failing? Can the EU learn from its failures? Where and what is the European digital rights movement? How do we make our advocacy more successful?\n\nIn recent months, these fails have received a great deal of attention in the press \u2013 Oettinger\u2019s Taliban attacks, Schroedinger\u2019s net neutrality, the cybercybercyber war and the repeated repackaging of ACTA. \n\nIt is reasonable to say that in a complex system like the European Union, system failure is a perpetual risk. However, for the defence of human rights and, indeed, many other policy issues, limiting those risks is absolutely essential. This is why we want to explore how we can gain insights and use valuable information from recent fails to fix the EU\u2019s vulnerabilities. Most importantly, if we wish to prevent the more serious failures in the future, we need to examine how and where our advocacy fails.\n\nAccess and European Digital Rights fight for digital rights at the EU level. Although we\u2019re detecting and fighting a large number of failures that the European Union produces with regard to digital policy-making, we\u2019re still very far from preventing the big fails. \n\nFor instance, instead of proposing real solutions to the migration crisis, the EU\u2019s shortsighted vision focuses on border surveillance. Instead of an urgently needed reform of Europe\u2019s privacy rules, its governments water down the protections for their citizens. Instead of safeguarding the open and neutral internet, the EU paves the way for discrimination by the big telcos. Instead of proposing evidence-based policies, the EU is trying to justify its proposals with evidence-making surveys. \n\nCertainly, Brussels is obscure, opaque, complicated and far away \u2013 but the decisions made there affect us all. Unfortunately, among the many reasons for a failing defense of human rights at EU-level is the political indifference and resignation in our community\u2122, a lack of understanding of the Brussels maze, a lack of awareness of the extent to which our national governments are directly involved in the policy-making process and a lack of communication about what happens in Brussels. During our talk, we therefore want to explore the following questions: Where and why is the European Union failing? Can the EU learn from its failures? Where and what is the European digital rights movement? How do we make our advocacy more successful?",

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "Memory corruption is an ongoing problem and in past years we have both developed a set of defense mechanisms and novel attacks against those defense mechanisms. Novel defense mechanisms like Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) promise to stop control-flow hijack attacks. We show that, while they make attacks harder, attacks often remain possible. Introducing novel attack mechanisms, like Control-Flow Bending (CFB), we discuss limitations of the current approaches. CFB is a generalization of data-only attacks that allows an attacker to execute code even if a defense mechanism significantly constrains execution.",
        "description": "Memory corruption plagues systems not just since Aleph1's article on stack smashing but since the dawn of computing. With the rise of defense techniques like stack cookies, ASLR, and DEP, attacks have grown more sophisticated but control-flow hijack attacks are still prevalent. Attackers can still launch code reuse attacks, often using some form of information disclosure. Stronger defense mechanisms have been proposed but none have seen wide deployment so far due to the time it takes to deploy a security mechanism, incompatibility with specific features, and most severely due to performance overhead.\n\nControl-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) are two of the hottest upcoming defense mechanisms. After quickly introducing them, we will discuss differences and advantages/disadvantages of both approaches, especially the security benefits they give under novel memory corruption attacks. CFI guarantees that the dynamic control flow follows the statically determined control-flow of the compiled program but an attacker may reuse any of the statically valid transitions at any control flow transfer. CPI on the other hand is a dynamic property that enforces memory safety guarantees like bounds checks for code pointers by separating code pointers from regular data. Data-only attacks are possible both for CFI and CPI.\n\nCounterfeit Object-Oriented Programming (COOP) and Control-Flow Bending (CFB) are two novel attack mechanisms. COOP reuses complete functions as gadgets, mitigating several defense mechanisms and CFB bends the control flow along valid but unintended paths in the control flow graph of a program. We will discuss COOP and CFB attacks, focusing on mitigating strong novel defense mechanisms.",

        "description": "Bringing an experiment into space aboard a sounding rocket or into the higher atmosphere aboard a balloon is not as hard as one might think. Students from Europe can simply write a proposal and apply for the REXUS/BEXUS programme, which is realised by an agreement between the German and Swedish space agencies, DLR (German: Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt) and SNSB (Swedish National Space Board, Swedish: Rymdstyrelsen). The Swedish share is furthermore accessible to teams from other European countries through ESA.\n\nFor REXUS, two sounding rockets are launched from northern Sweden every year, each one capable of carrying up to 5 experiments (max. experiment payload mass approx. 40kg) to an altitude of 80-90km. The experiments have to be engineered to withstand at least 20g of acceleration during ascent and descent, and experience milli-gravity when close to the apogee. In addition, the space specific thermal and vacuum environment need to be considered. Since the altitude is too low for reaching an orbit, the rocket motor and payload falls back to ground and is recovered by helicopters. The experiments are then returned to the student teams and the data from the 10min flight can be analysed, for instance, atmospheric measurements or technology demonstrators.\n\nSimilarly for BEXUS, two balloons per year are launched from the same location in Sweden and allow for carrying up to 12 experiments (max. 100kg). The balloon lifts the gondola with inside experiments to an altitude between 25-30km. After some hours of floating, the balloon is separated and the gondola descents on a parachute. The payload is then recovered by a helicopter and returned to the launch site by truck.\n\nDuring the talk we will present two experiments which we were involved in:\n- Fiber Optical Vibration Sensing Experiment launched on RX15 in May 2014, and\n- Advanced Receiver Concepts for ADS-B Experiment launched on BX18 in October 2014\nBeside this, we will explain, how other interested students can participate in the next REXUS/BEXUS cycle.\n",

        "description": "In 2014 the version 3 of North Korea's Red Star operating system was leaked. It is based on Linux and has the look and feel of a Mac. There is also a server version available. We will start the presentation by giving a general overview and presenting findings that already hit the net during the last year, like research on Red Star\u2019s custom browser and its configuration.\n\nThe focus of the presentation is to explain in depth how the architecture of the components is made up and to give a detailed overview of the privacy invading custom code implemented into the OS.\n\nThe system is designed to defend and protect itself from changes made from user space. We will analyze the interaction of the components and the protection mechanisms and provide information on how to deactivate some of the malicious functionality of Red Star OS. \nNorth Korea abuses the principals of free software to provide an operating system that suppresses free speech. Therefore we think it is necessary to disclose this information to the public and present the audience on how to get around the limitations introduced by North Korea.\n\nInvestigating functionality that can be used to invade the privacy of users was our primary goal. We found that the features implemented in Red Star OS are the wet dream of a surveillance state dictator. It provides a set of surveillance features like the capabilities to watermark different types of files that can be used to track the distribution of documents and multi-media files. We will have an in depth look on how some of these features built the foundation for a suppressive state in a modern world.",

Along with free public education, public healthcare, the scientific method, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Wikipedia, free software\u2026 It\u2019s one of those almost invisible infrastructures that we start to notice only once they go extinct. A place where all people can get access to all knowledge that can be collected seemed for a long time a dream beyond reach \u2013 until the egalitarian impetus of social revolutions, the Enlightment idea of universality of knowledge, and the expcetional suspension of the comercial barriers of copyright made it possible.\n\nThe Internet has, as in many other situations, completely changed our expectations and imagination about what is possible. The dream of a catalogue of the world \u2013 a universal access to all available knowledge for every member of society \u2013 became realizable. A question merely of the meeting of curves on a graph: the point at which the line of global distribution of personal computers meets that of the critical mass of people with access to the Internet. Today nobody lacks the imagination necessary to see public libraries as part of a global infrastructure of universal access to knowledge for literally every member of society. However, the emergence and development of the Internet is taking place precisely at the point at which an institutional crisis \u2014 one with traumatic and inconceivable consequences \u2014 has also begun.\n\nThe reactionary forces of the \u00bbold regime\u00ab are staging a \u00bbThermidor\u00ab to suppress the public libraries from pursuing their mission. Today public libraries cannot acquire, cannot even buy digital books from the world\u2019s largest publishers. The small amount of e-books that they were able to acquire they must destroy after only twenty-six lendings. Libraries and the principle of universal access to all existing knowledge that they embody are losing, in every possible way, the battle with a market dominated by new players such as Amazon.com, Google, and Apple.\n\nIn 2012, Canada\u2019s Conservative Party\u2013led government cut financial support for Libraries and Archives Canada (LAC) by Can$9.6 million, which resulted in the loss of 400 archivist and librarian jobs, the shutting down of some of LAC\u2019s Internet pages, and the cancellation of the further purchase of new books. In only three years, from 2010 to 2012, some 10 percent of public libraries were closed in Great Britain. The phenomena of which we people are most proud are being undercut and can easily go extinct.",

He will take you through the different mechanisms that can be created, simple processes for fabricating soft robots, and methods for joining elements together into sophisticated assemblies.",
        "description": "Soft robots are slowly trickling out of universities and labs into everyday life. Amazon is experimenting with installing soft grippers on robotic arms to pick any product off a warehouse shelf. DARPA just funded an extensive program to build soft exoskeletons for soldiers to enhance how much they can lift and how long they can march. My lab, Super-Releaser, is developing robotic spacesuit components for NASA as a subcontractor on a SBIR grant. On paper they might seem too complex to whip up at home, but if you\u2019re the kind of person who loved Creepy Crawlers and have access to a 3d printer you can make your very own soft robots.\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back to explain what a soft robot is and what they're good for. Most robots out there are made from hard parts like steel gears and plastic housings with the occasional rubber wheel or timing belt thrown in. When they respond to their environment it\u2019s usually by reading sensors and using a processor to change their behavior accordingly. This responsiveness is called compliance. There\u2019s another way to get compliance out of an engineered object, though: make the object soft. Everything from goat hooves to octopus tentacles, starfish suckers to human muscles, use softness and springiness to their advantage. When your robot responds to the environment by bending, say around the thing you\u2019re trying to grip, getting a specific output, like putting that thing in a box to get packed up and shipped off, becomes a lot simpler on the computation side of things. Adding compliant mechanisms to your engineering toolbox can add huge problem solving power to any robotics problem you're trying to tackle.\n\nIn this talk I\u2019m going to describe how I go about fabricating soft robots. There are lots of methods out there \u2013 from heat sealing, to stitching, to direct printing \u2013 but the method I prefer is casting. I like casting my robots from 3d printed molds because I can test multiple designs in parallel (just print out the different molds with, say, different wall thicknesses or numbers of ribs inside the actuators, all at the same time). It also allows me to experiment with designs in a context that matches the material I\u2019d be using if production were scaled up for mass manufacture. Finally, if I decide I really like the robot I\u2019ve created, making a dozen of them is just a matter of casting that same mold a dozen times.\n\nI\u2019m going to go over the materials I use and where to find them online, how to go about designing your own soft robot, and some interesting problems in soft robotics that are just waiting for solutions. I\u2019m going to be taking the audience from building the simplest actuators, to methods for fastening parts, to getting airtight seals even at high pressures, to putting everything together into a single-piece walking quadruped.",

We also extend our presentation with an overview of cache side-channel attacks, that use the same technique to evict data from the cache.",
        "description": "Last year, studies demonstrated Rowhammer, a fault attack that can cause random bit flips by repeatedly accessing DRAM rows. This vulnerability has already been exploited to gain root privileges and to evade a sandbox, showing the severity of faulting single bits for security. However, these exploits are written in native code and use special instructions that flush data from the cache.\n\nIn this talk we present Rowhammer.js [1], a JavaScript-based implementation of the Rowhammer attack. After presenting the native attack, we underline the challenges we faced to trigger the vulnerability from JavaScript, without any special instruction. Beyond DRAM, this attack also requires a very fine understanding of CPU cache internals, that are largely undocumented. We detail our findings on these undocumented parts, and the different steps that led to the attack from JavaScript. We also give an outlook on possible exploits, including gaining root privileges from JavaScript and performing fault attacks on cryptography.\n\nIn the last part, we extend our presentation with an overview of cache attacks, bridging the gap between hardware-fault attacks and side channels. In side-channel attacks, the attacker doesn't rely on a direct software compromise, but rather on passive observation of hardware characteristics when a victim process runs. In common with Rowhammer.js, these attacks use techniques to evict data from the last-level cache.\n\n[1] Daniel Gruss, Cl\u00e9mentine Maurice, Stefan Mangard.

We\u2019ll then go\nback for a close reading of the Snowden documents that were published at 31C3 and show how such a cryptanalytic exploit lines up exactly with several of the NSA\u2019s most powerful known decryption capabilities.\n\nFor those who prefer a more hands-on approach, we\u2019ll tell you how you too can experiment with breaking Diffie-Hellman for the \u201eexport-grade\u201c 512-bit key sizes that were mandated in the 1990s by U.S. crypto regulations. About 8% of popular HTTPS sites still support these weakened keys for use with legacy browsers, but we discovered a TLS protocol flaw, which we named the Logjam attack, that allowed a man-in-the-middle to trick all modern browsers into accepting them.\nWe\u2019re pretty sure your browser has shipped a security update to fix\nthis by now...\n\nWe\u2019ll conclude the talk by discussing what went wrong with\ncommunication between mathematical cryptographers and security\npractitioners, how we can prevent this from happening again, and what flavors of cryptography you should really be using to defend yourself.\n(Hint: It starts with \u201eelliptic\u201c and ends with \u201ecurve\u201c.)\n",

        "description": "Die Hitag Transponderfamilie besteht aus mehreren unterschiedlichen Transpondern, zu denen auch der Hitag S geh\u00f6rt. Der Hitag S Transponder wird von dem Hersteller NXP in erster Linie f\u00fcr die folgenden Zwecke empfohlen: W\u00e4scherei-Automation, Logistik, Lagerverwaltung und die \u00dcberwachung und Verwaltung von Tierherden. In der Realit\u00e4t werden Sie aber auch in Zutrittskontrollsystemen wie dem blueSmart-System der Firma Winkhaus eingesetzt.\n\nDer Hitag S Transponder bietet zwei Modi: Plain und Authentication. Im Authentication Mode ist der Zugriff auf den Speicher des Transponders erst nach einer erfolgreichen Authentifizierung m\u00f6glich. Grundlage der Authentifizierung ist ein 48Bit Pre-Shared-Key. F\u00fcr dieses Verfahren ist laut Hersteller leserseitig ein Krypto-Coprozessor erforderlich.\n\nIn diesem Vortrag  erl\u00e4utern wir die unterschiedlichen, bei dem Hitag S, erfolgreich durchgef\u00fchrten Angriffe zur \u00dcberwindung der Authentifizierung bzw. dem Brechen des verwendeten Schl\u00fcssels. Hierbei ber\u00fccksichtigen wir sowohl deren chronologische Entwicklung als auch ihre steigende Komplexit\u00e4t. Neben einem einfachen Replay-Angriff, der uns bereits Zugang zu den auf dem Transponder gespeicherten Daten gibt, kann auch der verwendete Schl\u00fcssel gebrochen werden. W\u00e4hrend entsprechende Angriffe f\u00fcr den Hitag 2 bereits bekannt sind, gilt der Hitag S in der Literatur noch nicht als gebrochen. Wir haben die beschriebenen Angriffe auf den Hitag S \u00fcbertragen.

In Abh\u00e4ngigkeit des gew\u00e4hlten Angriffs ben\u00f6tigen wir f\u00fcr das Brechen des Schl\u00fcssels zwischen mehreren hundert Tagen und 5 Minuten. Die hierf\u00fcr ben\u00f6tigten Daten k\u00f6nnen mit geeigneter Hardware innerhalb von wenigen Minuten durch Abh\u00f6ren der Funkkommunikation des Transponders mit einem Leser erhalten werden. \n\nWir haben einen Emulator gebaut, der jeden Hitag S Transponder nachbilden kann. Wird der Transponder in einem Schlie\u00dfsystem eingesetzt, k\u00f6nnen wir so eine Schl\u00fcsselkopie erstellen. \nBasierend auf unseren Ergebnissen und den Erfahrungen mit anderen Transpondern aus dem 125kHz Bereich k\u00f6nnen wir nur vor dem Einsatz in sicherheitskritischen Bereichen warnen. Hierbei ist es unerheblich, ob es sich um ein Online- oder Offline-System handelt. Keiner der uns bekannten 125 kHz Transponder verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber ausreichende Kryptographieverfahren, um derartige Angriffe abzuwehren. Daher ist, selbst bei starker Verschl\u00fcsselung der Daten auf dem Transponder, es immer m\u00f6glich mit einem Emulator einen exakten Klon zu erzeugen. Die Leseger\u00e4te, online wie offline, k\u00f6nnen diesen Klon nicht erkennen. Wenn die RFID-Anwendung die auf dem Transponder gespeicherten Daten nicht ausreichend sch\u00fctzt, k\u00f6nnen diese auch ver\u00e4ndert werden. Bei einer Schlie\u00dfanlage sind dann zum Beispiel beliebige \u00c4nderungen der Schlie\u00dfberechtigungen denkbar.\n",

A potential tragedy of the commons situation is approaching.\n\nAdditionally, there is a heavy new user on the block: mobile operators want to start utilizing those free 5GHz bands. Protocols labelled License-Assisted-Access (LAA) or LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) have been put into silicon and large scale rollout can be expected to start during 2016.\n\nThis talk presents a modification to OpenWRT that will help coping with increased interference load over the next years. We think this feature is necessary to avoid a tragedy-of-the-commons situation in license-exempt bands (2.4/5GHz) due to ever increasing demands and node densities. The same way as we would be frustrated when we are unable to measure the general noise level in a room prior to deciding to use it to have a verbal conversation in it.\n\nWe started testing this feature (modifications to the mac80211 sublayer and to luci) at this years BattleMeshV8 in Maribor, Slovenia. Public release is planned for November 2015.\n",

        "description": "The most well-known application of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography\">quantum cryptography</a> is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution\">Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)</a> which was invented in 1984 by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Bennett_%28computer_scientist%29\">Bennett</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Brassard\">Brassard</a>. QKD allows two players Alice and Bob to securely communicate over an insecure line which is overheard by an eavesdropper Eve. Security can be proven in an information-theoretic sense against an unrestricted Eve. Such a high level of security is impossible to achieve with classical communication. In the first part of the talk, I will introduce some basic concepts of quantum information theory in order to understand and appreciate the security of QKD.\n\nHowever, quantum cryptography offers a wide range of <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06120\">other applications</a> that go beyond the task of key distribution. For instance, the goal of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography#Position-based_quantum_cryptography\">\u201cposition-based cryptography\u201d</a> is to use a player\u2019s physical position as cryptographic credential. The combination of relativistic constraints (assuring that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light) and quantum mechanical effects (such as the impossibility to perfectly copy a quantum state) enables entirely new cryptographic applications like sending a message in such a way that it can only be read at a particular geographic position. In the second part, I will introduce you to this intriguing new branch of quantum cryptography.",

Therefore, it is not too surprising that it has security problems. However, it turns out that it has way too many problems. In this talk, we introduce how you can freely send data in the cellular network, and how an attacker can perform caller spoofing and denial of service attacks on calls to disable the target\u2019s calling. Furthermore, we explain how small implementation glitch on VoLTE may lead to break the whole cellular network down.",
        "description": "Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) is a newly adopted voice technology in the LTE network, whose functionality is similar to VoIP. Even though VoLTE works similar to VoIP, implementing it on the cellular network is not an easy problem because it needs many changes at each component of LTE. If these changes are not securely considered, this may lead to several security problems.\n \nIn the legacy 3G network, as data and voice are separate, the accounting policies are also different: data is charged based on byte usage, and voice, on time usage. However, in VoLTE, even though voice is delivered as a packet, it is still charged by time usage. Therefore, this strange accounting policy might open free data channels.\n \nAnother point is that voice signaling for VoLTE is not handled as in the legacy 3G network. Basically, a phone has two processors: an application processor (AP) which runs mobile OSes such as Android and a communication processor (CP) which manages digital signal processing and radio access. In 3G, voice signaling is handled in CP which makes an attacker hard to manipulate it. However, in VoLTE, because voice signaling is handled in AP, an attacker can easily analyze or modify the call flow. Furthermore, this new change can cause problems to the mobile OS.\n\nTo scrutinize these two points, we analyzed 5 operators, two in the U.S and three in South Korea. As a result, we found four free data channels. For free data channels, an attacker can inject data in the call signaling procedure or voice data transmission. Additionally, the attacker can freely send data to the Internet or to another phone in the cellular network through the VoLTE interface. Furthermore, we discovered five security problems which include no encryption of voice packets, no authentication of call signaling, no call session management, IMS bypassing, and permission model mismatch in Android. We responsibly disclosed all the vulnerabilities to US/KR CERTs and Google in May. We suggest mitigations for each vulnerability, and further propose possible attack vectors that researchers can study on.",

We strongly suggest that audience members have some familiarity with functional programming. A strong mathematical background is NOT required.\n\nTL;DR: Math is cool again, we now have the tools for \"executable math\". Also: iptables!",
        "description": "We all know that writing large firewall rulesets can be hard. One huge problem. Let's write a tool to statically verify some properties of our rulesets! Now we have three huge problems:\n(1) writing flawless firewall rulesets.\n(2) making sure that our verification tool does the right thing.\n(3) making sure that the internal firewall model of our tool corresponds to the real world.\n\nIn this talk, we will solve these problems from front to back. We focus on problems (2) and (3). Warning: this talk involves math!\n\nFirst, we need to specify the behavior of the Linux netfilter/iptables firewall. In order to be convincing, this model must be small and simple. It should fit on one slide. However, firewalls can be quite complex and the model must cope with this. For example, looking at `man iptables-extensions`, we see numerous match conditions. But nobody required that our model must be executable code; we will specify the model mathematically. For example, this allows to define <i>arbitrary</i> match conditions. Technically speaking, we define the filtering behavior of iptables in terms of bigstep semantics. Mathematical specifications can be very powerful, in particular when we get to the point where the specification is not directly \"executable\".\n\nEnough math, let's write some executable code to do something with our ruleset. For example, unfolding the jumps to user-defined chains, checking that some packets will be certainly blocked, or checking that we got the spoofing protection right.\n\nSecond, based on our firewall model, we can now prove that our algorithms do the right thing. In contrast to testing, a mathematical proof allows assertions for all possible values. For example: For all possible packets, rulesets, and firewall-matching-features, our unfolding algorithm does not change the filtering behavior of the firewall. Yes, we can even show that our tool will still be correct, even if the netfilter team pushes a new matching feature.\n\nFinally, we now have a verified verification tool. We can use it to verify our firewall ruleset and finally sleep well at night again.\n\nWe developed an iptables verification library over the last few years in Isabelle/HOL. Isabelle can export executable definitions (i.e. our algorithms) to functional languages such as Haskell, Scala, SML, or OCcaml. Writing the input/output functions manually in Haskell, we have a fast and stand-alone tool.\n\nThis talk is also an introduction to interactive theorem proving and programming in Isabelle/HOL.

        "description": "The terms \u201csocial innovation\u201d and \u201csocial innovators\u201d have become commonplace expressions in technology and development fields. More people have created new kinds of businesses and solutions to create positive impact in the society instead of just bringing interests to the partners of the company. However, in the last two decades, most resources available to build solutions for international development challenges were provided to institutions in richer countries. Most of the solutions, therefore, were coming from outside the local context or community. There are very few examples that show low-income people as responsible designers for good solutions. Several reasons try to explain why this has happened, but one essential reasoning is the belief that well educated people have more capacity to reach a good solution for any context, even if these people do not belong to the local culture or context. However, the main results of this methodology are anything but understanding and positive. The four main results are: dependence, lack of user needs understanding, (and, as such) little or no sense of ownership, and lack of maintenance.\nIn order to address these four problems, different approaches to social innovation have started to be tested. One model that tries to explain these different approaches are called Design For, Design With, Design By. If this model is studied deeper, it is possible to recognize that it translates the passage from the donator solutions mindset to the capacity-building solutions mindset. The two main parameters to define to understand the difference between those approaches is \u201cdesigner\u201d and \u201cuser.\u201d Design For expresses the fact the designer has very limited interaction with the user (typically only in the information gathering stage at the beginning and user testing at the end). This is typically what appropriate technology development looks like. Design With, also called co-creation and participatory development, brings together the user and the designer to understand the problem together, create solutions together and make decisions together in order to keep the project going forward. Design By defines the approach where the designer is also the user (and vice versa) or belongs to the same environment as the user. To test the Design By model, our Donor IDIN (www.idin.org) opted to support a local Innovation Center in a favela in Latin America, more specifically in S\u00e3o Paulo that the local organization Caos Focado has been responsible.",

In Germany, the lack of data disaggregated by race and ethnicity means that there are no figures on the extent of racially or ethnically based discrimination. Germany presents a unique case for examining the collection of disaggregated data due largely to the term race, or Rasse, having negative connotations due to the misuse of such data during the Nazi era.\n\nThis talk will focus on the potential ability of data disaggregated by race and ethnicity to reduce discriminatory policing in Germany, with a particular focus on \u2018stop and search.\u2019 Stop and search is a crime-prevention practice existing in both Germany and the UK which allows police officers to stop individuals they suspect of committing a crime, carrying a weapon, possessing stolen property, or carrying drugs. In Germany, federal police have the added power to stop a person suspected of committing an immigration violation.\n\nIn the UK \u2013 due to pressure from civil society organisations, academics, and government officials \u2013 data has been collected during police procedures, allowing for a monitoring and evaluation of discriminatory policing practices.

        "abstract": "In this presentation I will present the experimental language Ling. We shall get an intuitive understanding of the language through familiar concepts from imperative programming. We shall cover how Ling enables a modular and precise control on memory allocation, through  a general optimization called fusion. This optimization, fusion is a cost-free abstraction mechanism which brings high level programming to system programming.",
        "description": "The design of <a href=\"https://github.com/np/ling\">Ling</a> is the result of my researches in collaboration with Daniel Gustafsson and Nicolas Guenot at the IT-University of Copenhagen and also from the language <a href=\"https://lopezjuan.com/limestone/\">Limestone</a> by Jean-Philippe Bernardy and V\u00edctor L\u00f3pez Juan at the University of Chalmers.  These two lines of research stand upon the longstanding research topics of process calculi (such as the \u03c0-calculus), term calculi (such as \u03bb-calculus), Linear Logic, and dependent Type Theory (such as used in Coq and Agda to write proofs and programs).\n\nThe research on the \u03bb-calculus and Type Theory gave rise to a powerful family of languages including but not limited to: Haskell, OCaml, Coq, Idris, and Agda. The research on the \u03c0-calculus gave rise to a vast family of calculi for concurrency. However type systems for these languages took much longer to emerge and progress. For instance the main concurrent programming language in use today is still dynamically typed. This is changing as we understand better how to the use the formulae of Linear Logic as behavior types (or session types) for concurrent processes.\n\nStill the aim of this experimental language is to program systems precisely and modularly. The need for precision comes from the resource constraints such as memory, file handles and the need for modularity comes the desire to reduce programming mistakes by solving problems at the right abstraction level. Functional programming offers a pretty good framework for modularity. This modularity comes at a cost which is rather difficult to predict. One the one hand optimizing compilers can fuse function composition to eliminate the need for intermediate data-structures. One the other hand when such an optimization fails to trigger the resulting program might poorly perform. The system of Ling controls when fusion can happen. Therefore one knows statically when fusion occurs and when intermediate buffers are needed.\n\nToday concurrent systems are built out of shared memory. However, the shared memory model is a nightmare for programmers. Here the approach is reversed we start from a concurrent programming language and apply it also for shared memory. At first the goal is not necessarily to target a parallel architecture but to program at level of abstraction where the programmer knows precisely the resources needed and the compiler still has plenty of opportunity to re-order and parallelize safely some instructions.\n\nThis talk is intended at an audience familiar with imperative programming. Using the language should not require to understand anything about Linear Logic even though it is used fundamentally. Finally this presentation is an open call for comments and contributions to the open development of the language and infrastructure.\n",

While it may seem simple to replace IP addresses or ports there are still quite a number of network packet details that are hard to replace. This technical talk will shed a light on where those troublemakers are encountered and how to get around them.",
        "description": "When sanitizing/anonymizing PCAPs (or the newer, better, but also much more complex PCAPng network capture file format) there are a ton of problems to run into: Replacement need to be consistent, Checksums need to be recalculated sometimes but now always, and IPv6 has dependencies to MAC addresses that need to be considered as well. Additionally, protocols may be stacked on top of each other, tunneling IPv4 over IPv4 or IPv6 over IPv4, adding complexity to the replacement process. And finally, sanitizing TCP payloads is a certifiable nightmare because you never quite know what you're looking at, and the data segments may require reassembly/unpacking before you can do anything. It's easy to break sequence numbers, unless every replacement is exactly the same size as the original value. This talk will take a closer look at some of the typical problems that come up when sanitizing/anonymizing network packet captures, and at tools that can help with getting reasonable results.",

Not so many people seem to be concerned about the other side of the coin though, which is an ever-growing influence of algorithms on our personal life and the accompanying shift of decision power from humans to machines. In as little as 10 years, algorithms might decide if you get a new job \u2013 or if you get fired from your current one \u2013, how much you will pay for your health insurance, whether you will be allowed to travel to a given country and who you will marry. So it\u2019s time to say hi to your new boss: the algorithm.\n\nOften people talk either about the consequences of a data-driven society, or about the technological aspects of it, but rarely about the two together. With my talk I want to change that by discussing concrete technologies and algorithms that are used in data analysis today, together with their societal and political implications. I will show how algorithms can be trained to be racist, misogynic and plenty of other things, and that this actually happens in practice if no care is taken to avoid it. Finally, I will discuss various approaches to solve this dilemma, both technological and political.\n\nOutline:\n\n* Introduction to \u201ebig data\u201c and data analysis,\n* Parts of our lives that are already under algorithmic control,\n* Parts of our lives that soon will be under algorithmic control,\n* Example use case of algorithms in data science,\n* How machine learning can discriminate against certain groups of people,\n* Example algorithm: Classifying people in good and bad customers,\n* How the bias comes about: Algorithm-based discrimination,\n* How we can fix these problems.\n* Outlook.",

Most uses are rather pedestrian though, and even the more non-standard modifications to pure QR codes lack a certain technical finesse, opting to just overpaint part of the code and let error correction handle that instead. Let's see how we can do better.",
        "description": "The simple visual appearance of a QR code belies a very complex multi-step encoding process: Text is encoded using one or multiple character sets and encoding modes (allowing, for example, for a more efficient representation of strings of numbers), the resultant data is grouped into code words in segments with delimiters, error correction information is added, the augmented data is placed on the 2D matrix, structure obfuscation with a masking pattern is applied and version and format meta-data is added. each of these steps grants some degree of freedom to the encoder that will result in visually distinct but semantically identical codes.\n\nPrevious approaches to play with QR code appearance have usually stuck to modifying either end of this pipeline: Overwriting some parts of the finished code, or adding additional encoded data so that the finished code will have certain features embedded in it. The downside of these approaches is that you either rely on error correction to remove all the disturbances you've added, limiting the amount of modification possible, or become very limited in which pixels you can control.\n\nBy constructing an encoder and decoder that allows access to each step of the encoding/decoding process, I will allow you to go further and take control of the QR code as a whole. Changing all parameters of the encoding process will make the resulting code appear almost like you want it without relying on the error correcting capabilities, which then allows you to add further manipulations by abusing the error correction capabilities.\n\nAll code will be released under a free software license at the same time as the talk.",

Unfortunately the implementation was difficult to incorporate into normal system boot in a secure manner - anybody able to observe a user could recreate the secret. This presentation describes a method to allow systems to prove their identity to the user without making it trivial for attackers to mimic a secure boot and extract secrets from the user, and why the state of modern hardware means this may still not be enough.",
        "description": "A correctly implemented Trusted Boot solution makes it possible for systems to prove to other systems that they have booted with the expected boot chain. The Anti Evil Maid technique took advantage of this to encrypt a secret with the TPM in such a way that a system whose firmware or bootloader had been compromised would no longer be able to decrypt that secret. Unfortunately, the use of a static secret makes it easier for an attacker to mimic a good boot - as a result, a sufficiently motivated attacker could circumvent Anti Evil Maid and convince the user that a compromised system was in a good state.\n\nThis presentation describes the use of shared trust between the system and another device, making it significantly more difficult for an attacker to mimic a trusted boot. It includes a description of the implementation of Trusted Boot support in Free operating systems on modern UEFI systems, how this can be tied into sharing trust between multiple devices and the limitations that may still permit state-level actors to compromise these techniques.",

Their primary purpose is the discovery and exploitation of structure in an entropic environment, but they are capable to something much more sinister, too: they give rise to meaning.\nMinds are the solution to a control problem: in our case, this problem amounts to navigating a social primate through a complex open environment in an attempt to stave off entropy long enough to serve evolutionary imperatives. Minds are capable of second-order control: they create representational structures that serve as a model of their environment. And minds are capable or rationality: they can learn how to build models that are entirely independent of their subjective benefit for the individual. \nBecause we are the product of an evolutionary process, our minds are constrained by powerful safeguards against becoming fully rational in the way we construct these models: our motivational system can not only support our thinking and decision making to optimize individual rewards, but censor and distort our understanding to make us conform to social and evolutionary rewards. This opens a security hole for mind-viruses: statebuilding systems of beliefs that manage to copy themselves across populations and create causal preconditions to serve neither individuals nor societies, but primarily themselves.\nI will introduce a computational model of belief attractors that can help us to explain how our minds can become colonized and governed by irrational beliefs that co-evolve with social institutions.\nThis talk is part of a series of insights on how to use the epistemology of Artificial Intelligence to understand the nature of our minds.",

        "abstract": "Is your email being sent in the clear? While PGP and S/MIME provide end-to-end encrypted mail, most users have yet to adopt these practices, and for users who have, these tools leave metadata, such as the subject, sender, and recipient, visible everywhere along a message\u2019s path. SMTP&mdash;the ubiquitous mail transport protocol&mdash;has evolved over the years to add encryption and authentication, both of which take place behind the scenes and help guard against surveillance and spam. While these features are being increasingly deployed, our research shows that they are almost always configured in vulnerable ways&mdash;the details of which are hidden from the users sending and receiving mail. Even more disturbingly, these vulnerabilities are being widely exploited in the wild: in seven countries, more than 20% of inbound Gmail messages are downgraded to cleartext by network-based attacks. In the most severe case, 96% of messages sent from Tunisia to Gmail are downgraded to cleartext. In this talk, I\u2019ll introduce the commonly used SMTP security extensions&mdash;including STARTTLS, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC&mdash;and describe the current state of mail security on the Internet. I'll describe several commonly occurring attacks our recent research has found and discuss how mail operators can configure their servers to secure email transport. Finally, I'll discuss several weaknesses in the protocols we're using and recent proposals for helping secure email transport.",
        "description": "<p>Email carries some of our most sensitive communication, including private correspondence, financial details, and password recovery confirmations. We expect that messages are private and, in many cases, unforgeable. However, SMTP&mdash;the protocol responsible for relaying messages between mail servers&mdash;did not originally authenticate senders or encrypt mail in transit. Instead, servers support these features through SMTP extensions. Adopting these features is entirely voluntary and they have only been gradually adopted. As a consequence, mail servers still tolerate unprotected communication and will send messages in clear text if any problems occur when negotiating a secure connection.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, I worked with colleagues at the University of Michigan and Google to measure the global adoption of email security features and try to better understand how well email is secured in practice.  Our study draws from two unique data sources: connection logs for Gmail spanning 16 months, plus a snapshot of SMTP server configurations from April 2015 for the Alexa Top Million domains. From Gmail\u2019s perspective, incoming messages protected by TLS have increased 82% over the last year, peaking at 60% of all inbound mail. However, this improvement was largely because a small number of popular web mail providers deployed TLS&mdash;many organizations still haven't deployed these features correctly. I will discuss these results and many more that reveal several major weaknesses in the global deployment of mail transport security.</p>\n\n<p>This security patchwork enables network attackers to intercept and surveil email. In one kind of attack, actors corrupt the TLS handshakes at the the start of an SMTP connection to downgrade the connection to cleartext&mdash;exposing messages to potential eavesdropping. Using Internet-wide scanning, we identified more than 41,000 SMTP servers in 193 countries that are routinely forced to deliver email as cleartext.  We analyzed the mail sent to Gmail from these hosts and find that in seven countries, more than 20% of all messages are prevented from being encrypted by active network attacks. In the most severe case, 96% of messages sent from Tunisia to Gmail are downgraded to cleartext, but even in Denmark, nearly 4% of messages are affected.</p>\n\n<p>In a second class of attack, DNS servers provide fraudulent MX records for popular email providers. We searched for servers that provide fraudulent addresses for Gmail\u2019s SMTP servers, and we find 14.6K publicly accessible DNS servers in 69 countries provide falsified responses. We investigate the messages that Gmail received from these hosts and find that in 193 countries more than 0.01% of messages from each country are transited through these impostor hosts. Six of the eight most-affected countries are in Europe.</p>\n \n<p>In this talk, I will first introduce the security extensions for SMTP and the current state of mail security. Then, drawing on our measurements, I will discuss the weaknesses in these protocols and the attacks we see occurring in the wild. I'll discuss what  mail server operators, developers, and even end users, can do to protect against these problems. Finally, I will present current proposals for securing mail transport and several weaknesses that we still need to address.</p>",

        "description": "Randomness is as simple as critical. An application wants some bytes which an attacker can't predict. The clearest example is generating a cryptographic key, but a wide array of functions depend on randomness.\n\nAny time a key is generated, any time a DSA signature is made, any time the memory layout is randomized, applications rely on being able to create strings of bytes impossible to predict. If that comes short everything fails: cryptographic keys are compromised, exploits protections are ineffective.\n\nEntropy, the unpredictable raw material, is usually collected by the Operating System and exposed to the applications that need it. Once enough bits of entropy have been collected, it becomes impossible to predict the output of the CSPRNG (cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator), a stirrer of sorts that expands a seed into unlimited whitened random bytes, often based on stream ciphers or hashes.\n\nReal risks include trying to use a CSPRNG early on in the boot process, when not enough random events have been collected, or using a userspace CSPRNG instead of the kernel one and forgetting to seed it. Or using a non-CS PRNG.\n\nThat's just about it. However, there is a lot of misunderstanding on \"decreasing entropy\". It's a widespread myth that using random bytes decreases the \"amount\" of entropy. Reality is, to an attacker who's basically trying to predict the CSPRNG output there's no decrease in difficulty no matter how much output is drawn, so developers can avoid introducing additional complexity because of this.\n\nThis is all backed up by showing a simple toy CSPRNG design, and reasoning about its properties.\n\nMore practically, the points above translate into \"in Linux, just use /dev/urandom or the get_random syscall\". That's the kernel interface for the system CSPRNG. Its inner working are presented and they will hopefully make it clear why there is no meaningful difference from the \"counting\" /dev/random.",

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "    Embedded systems are omnipresent in our everyday life and are becoming \n    increasingly present in many computing and networked environments. For example,\n    they are at the core of various Common-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices such as\n    printers, video surveillance systems, home routers and virtually anything we \n    informally call electronics. The emerging phenomenon of the Internet-of-Things\n    (IoT) will make them even more widespread and interconnected. Cisco famously\n    predicted that there will be 50 billion connected embedded devices by 2020.\n    Given those estimations, the heterogeneity of technology and application fields,\n    and the current threat landscape, the security of all those devices becomes of\n    paramount importance. In addition to this, manual security analysis does not\n    scale. Therefore, novel, scalable and automated approaches are needed.\n    In this talk, we present several methods that make *the large scale\n    security analyses of embedded devices* a feasible task. We implemented \n    those techniques in a scalable framework that we tested on real world data. \n    First, we collected a large number of firmware images from Internet \n    repositories and then performed simple static analysis. \n    Second, since embedded devices often expose web interfaces for \n    remote administration, therefore we developed techniques for large scale \n    static and dynamic analysis of such interfaces. \n    Finally, identifying and classifying the firmware files, as well as \n    fingerprinting and identifying embedded devices is difficult, especially \n    at large scale. \n    Using these techniques, we were able to discover a large number of new \n    vulnerabilities in dozens of firmware packages, affecting a great variety of vendors and\n    device classes. We were also able to achieve high accuracy in fingerprinting and\n    classification of both firmware images and live devices.",
        "description": "This material is both important and innovative because it addresses the \nmore and more pressing matter of securing/hacking the IoT, hence the \nembedded devices themselves. Moreover, it's envisioned that the topic will \ngo in the next few years from important to critically important. \n\nThis material is definitely innovative because it will provide technical \naspects of security research by combining several interesting \nresearch directions:\n- non-x86 emulation (and the caveats)\n- some aspects of static and dynamic analysis\n- machine learning\n- device fingerprinting\n\nThis material is significant because it will present the results, knowledge \nand insights that resulted from three years of experimentation and work \nusing systematic, methodological and academic approaches. \n\nAudience will be presented with technical knowledge, demos, insights, lessons \nlearned and open challenges. \n",

        "description": "Modern vehicles have several advanced driver assistant systems (ADASs). This is the beginning of the full automation of the driving task. Vehicle manufacturers already showed first fully automated prototypes but a lot of challenges have to be addressed until such systems will be commercially available. One challenge is to provide the necessary information for the self-driving vehicle to make the right driving decisions. V2V communication is one possible technology to provide this information. The proposed talk is an introduction to the state of the art of V2V communication based on IEEE 802.11p.\n\nThis talk is a technical introduction to Vehicle2Vehicle communication. It will introduce the basic concepts of V2V technology and provides references to documents of the standardization. The talk will consist of the following parts:\n\nMotivation:\nThe talk starts by describing the scope and possible applications of V2V communication focusing on the use-case of the \u201cElectronic Emergency Break Light\u201d. What is more, V2V communication will be compared to traditional on-board sensors like Lidar or Radar.\n\nBasic concepts:\nThe state of the art concepts of V2V communication based on IEEE 802.11p and its differences compared to consumer WiFi will be discussed in this section. Furthermore, the existing concepts and standards developed in both Europe and the U.S. will be compared, with a special focus on the differences between the two approaches. In summary, the following questions will be addressed:\n\u2022\tWhat are the approaches for V2V communication in Europe and the U.S.?  \n\u2022\tHow is communication realized for V2V?\n\u2022\tWhich standardization approaches exist and where can they be found?\n\u2022\tWhat are the most important disseminated information and messages?\n\u2022\tHow are these messages formatted? (header structure)\n\u2022\tWhat are the differences between the V2V communication concepts in the U.S and Europe ?\n\u2022\tWhich technical challenges have to be solved?\n\nPrivacy and Security:\nAs V2V communication will be used to broadcast the vehicle\u2019s position and dynamic state, the privacy of the driver has to be protected. The talk will introduce the pursued concepts for privacy protection, whilst ensuring that only authorized entities are able participate in the communication. Due to the complexity of the topic, this section will focus on the concepts and the standards found in Europe.\n\nPerspective:\nEventually, the talk will address future work within the field of V2V communication, such as novel ADASs and privacy concepts.\n\nRemarks: The talk is only about the state of the art of V2V technology, its standardization and its further development.\n",

        "subtitle": "Large Scale Authorship Attribution from Executable Binaries of Compiled Code and Source Code",
        "abstract": "Last year I presented research showing how to de-anonymize programmers based on their coding style. This is of immediate concern to open source software developers who would like to remain anonymous. On the other hand, being able to de-anonymize programmers can help in forensic investigations, or in resolving plagiarism claims or copyright disputes. \n\nI will report on our new research findings in the past year. We were able to increase the scale and accuracy of our methods dramatically and can now handle 1,600 programmers, reaching 94% de-anonymization accuracy. In ongoing research, we are tackling the much harder problem of de-anonymizing programmers from binaries of compiled code. This can help identify the author of a suspicious executable file and can potentially aid malware forensics. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques using a dataset collected from GitHub.",
        "description": "It is possible to identify individuals by de-anonymizing different types of large datasets. Once individuals are de-anonymized, different types of personal details can be detected from data that belong to them. Furthermore, their identities across different platforms can be linked. This is possible through utilizing machine learning methods that represent human data with a numeric vector that consists of features. Then a classifier is used to learn the patterns of each individual, to classify a previously unseen feature vector.\n \nTor users, social networks, underground cyber forums, the Netflix dataset have been de-anonymized in the past five years. Advances in machine learning and the improvements in computational power, such as cloud computing services, make these large scale de-anonymization tasks possible in a feasible amount of time. As data aggregators are collecting vast amounts of data from all possible digital media channels and as computing power is becoming cheaper, de-anonymization threatens privacy on a daily basis.\n \nLast year, we showed how we can de-anonymize programmers from their source code. This is an immediate concern for programmers who would like to remain anonymous. (Remember Saeed Malekpour, who was sentenced to death after the Iranian government identified him as the web programmer of a porn site.) We scaled our method to 1,600 programmers after last year\u2019s talk on identifying source code authors via stylometry. We reach 94% accuracy in correctly identifying the 1,600 authors of 14,400 source code samples. These results are a breakthrough in accuracy and magnitude when compared to related work.\n \nThis year we have been focusing on de-anonymizing programmers from their binaries of compiled code. Identifying stylistic fingerprints in binaries is much more difficult in comparison to source code. Source code goes through compilation to generate binaries and some stylistic fingerprints get lost in translation while some others survive. We reach 65% accuracy, again a breakthrough, in de-anonymizing binaries of 100 authors.\n \nDe-anonymization is a threat to privacy but it has many security enhancing applications. Identifying authors of source code helps aid in resolving plagiarism issues, forensic investigations, and copyright-copyleft disputes. Identifying authors of binaries can help identify the author of a suspicious executable file or even be extended to malware classification. We show how source code and binary authorship attribution works on a real world datasets collected from GitHub.\n\nI hope this talk raises awareness on the dangers of de-anonymization while showing how it can be helpful in resolving conflicts in some other areas. Binary de-anonymization could potentially enhance security by identifying malicious actors such as malware writers or software thieves.\n \nI would like to conclude by mentioning two future directions. Can binary de-anonymization be used for malware family classification and be incorporated to virus detectors? Obfuscators are not the counter measure to de-anonymizing programmers. We can identify the authors of obfuscated code with high accuracy. There is an immediate need for a code anonymization framework, especially for all the open source software developers who would like to remain anonymous.",

        "description": "Surveillance was on the street before it was online, and that hasn\u2019t changed. What has changed is that cities around the world are now bristling with street level surveillance technology, like GPS tracking devices, IMSI catchers, biometrics, drones, and cameras of all kinds. Much like the business of selling malware to repressive regimes, big multi-national corporations like General Electric and Morpho have made huge profits off the spread of this technology, and have helped it spread like wildfire.  \n\nEven in places like the United States, where, in the last 20 years, crime rates have steadily and significantly declined, the use of this incredibly invasive technology is excused by \u201cpublic safety\" or \"crime prevention needs.\u201d Justifications range from warnings about terrorism (often thinly-veiled jabs at activists like the Black Lives Matter movement or anti-austerity activists in Greece) to conflating \u201cnational security\u201d with disaster preparedness. Similarly, In Latin American, government authorities  have used surveillance measures to discredit and stigmatize social movements involved in protests.  \n\nStreet level surveillance is also often part of preparation for major events. The technology left behind becomes integrated in to everyday policing. The 2012 Olympics in London was accompanied by a host of new technology, including iris scanners, biometric ID cards, automated license plate readers, and facial-recognition CCTV systems. In preparation for the 2014 World Cup Games, Brazil spent millions on CCTV, drones, facial recognition goggles, surveillance helicopters, and a mobile high-frequency radio wave scanner, as well as 14 digital command centers across the country (featuring huge ceiling-to-wall monitors to facilitate real-time monitoring of surveillance cameras.) The country also integrated their national and international databases with cooperating parties, like Interpol, and subjected Brazilians to this invasive data collection technique.  Intelligence agents mapped protest routes and monitored demonstrators by tracking their social media accounts. The 2016 Brazil Olympics are sure to make use of this technology\u2014and provide an excuse for more.  \n\nThis talk will cover what kind of street level technology we\u2019re seeing, how it\u2019s spreading, and who\u2019s making money off of it. We\u2019ll also talk about some of the security flaws hackers have exposed on these technologies, and put out a call to action to CCC. \n\nSpeakers are:\nNadia Kayyali, Activist at Electronic Frontier Foundation. They focus on street level surveillance technology such as IMSI catchers and drones, US national security policy, privacy, anonymity, and freedom of expression. Nadia has worked on EFF\u2019s Street Level Surveillance and Surveillance Self-Defense projects, advocated for anonymity and privacy with governmental bodies and companies like Facebook, and has coordinated a variety of US campaigns to limit surveillance at the national and local level. As a Syrian-American, Nadia got especially interested in surveillance because of the experiences of Arab and Muslim Americans after 9/11. \n\nJoana Varon, Founder and Director of\u00a0Coding rights and consultant and independent researcher on Internet Governance and Digital Rights. Previously, Joana was a researcher and project coordinator at the Centre for Technology and Society from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro. While there, she worked on applied research on information and communication technology for development. Joana is a lawyer and holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in international relations and a master\u2019s degree in law and development.

        "description": "Hacking receives growing attention among social scientists during the last five years. Researchers particularly in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) but also in the social sciences generally have begun to study hacking empirically\u2014investigating hacking as a practice and as cultural phenomenon.\n\nHowever, Fefe, an influential blogger of the German hacking community, warned against collaborating with researchers: \n\n \u201eIn letzter Zeit gibt es eine auff\u00e4llige H\u00e4ufung von Befragungen und wissenschaftlichen Studien zu Hackern und Piraten, wie die Szene funktioniert und so weiter, auch bei Hackerspaces und insbesondere auch bei Gruppen wie Occupy und co. Wenn so jemand bei euch anklopft, sagt ihm bitte nichts. Nur weil die freundlich und nett wirken, muss man noch nicht kooperieren.\nNanu, hat der Fefe was gegen Wissenschaft? Nein. Aber was die meisten nicht auf dem Radar haben: Solche \"Studien\" werden von den B\u00f6sen gemacht. Dahinter stecken Public Relations Consulting-Firmen, Risk-Management-Firmen, Politikberatung, Thinktanks. Die haben Angst vor uns und wollen uns ausforschen. Und wie macht man das? Man schickt unverd\u00e4chtige V-Leute. In diesem Fall nerdige Wissenschaftler, die freundlich anfragen.\u201d (7.2.2013, blog.fefe.de/?ts=afed4222)\n\nIn this talk, I will not be able to speak about undercover spying for corporate or government interest (because I don\u2019t know any more about it than Fefe). Instead, this talk will be about the research that some of those \u2018nerdy scientists\u2019 that Fefe mentions do\u2014researchers like my collaborator and me who thought: Hacking! Yes! That\u2019s an interesting phenomenon, and it is important! For many social scientists, hacking is interesting because it challenges their academic thinking and their academic vision. It challenges the categories in which some research fields usually think (e.g., \u2018the user\u2019 as opposed to \u2018the designer\u2019). And it also can challenge how disciplines such as HCI (who perceive themselves as advocates for prospective users) envision themselves. \n \nThe talk offers a glimpse of the spectrum of research about hacking in HCI, CSCW, and adjacent fields. Researchers in these fields portray hacking very differently. The spectrum ranges from \u201ctransgressive craft\u201d to \u201cinnovative leisure practice,\u201d from skilled craftsmanship to ad hoc kludging, from an individualist pursuit to a community mission, from an expression of liberalism to an exclusive practice of cultural distinction.

Other researchers see it as the future of \u201cend-user innovation.\u201d\n\nClearly, there is often vested academic interests in the ways in which social scientists portray hacking. In some cases, there is an interest in emphasizing the economic value of hacking, highlighting its creative and innovative potential. In other cases, there is an interest in emphasizing the pedagogical value of hacking, highlighting its potential as a means of teaching and learning. In still other cases, there is a conceptual interest in hacking or an interest in its cultural value. And yes, in some cases there is clearly an interest in simply preventing hacking. \n\nMy personal motivation to study hacking has a lot to do with my conceptual interest in notions such as \u2018use\u2019 and \u2018design.\u2019 Is hacking using, is it designing, is it both? And I find it interesting to note that hacking practices often react to a condition where the possibilities of \u2018use\u2019 are perceived as very limited. But my personal motivation to study and write about hacking in the HCI/CSCW community also stems from discontentment with the way in which HCI/CSCW research often sidelines the political visions of hacking\u2014most notably, the vision of \u2018open,\u2019 community-driven technology that is an \u2018expression of liberalism\u2019 (Gabriela Coleman).\n\nMy motivation to give this talk is to communicate research back to those who are the subjects of research. The research discourse is, besides the mass media discourse, an important place for creating a public image of \u2018the hacker.\u2019 Moreover, I would like to discuss Fefe\u2019s warning\u2014\u201cdo not talk with researchers,\u201d is that what 32C3 thinks? And what, after all, is hacking?\n",

In this talk we\u2019ll harness the might of the English dictionary, cut corners to achieve sane running times for insane computations, and use fancy Machine Learning\u00ae methods \u2013 all in order to build a classifier with a higher standard for gibberish plausibility.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a rising trend in malware\u2019s use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) as a fallback mechanism in case the campaign is shut down at the DNS level. DGAs are a headache to deal with, but they have one big drawback \u2013 they make a lot of noise. To be more precise, they generate a very large amount of DNS requests for domains, and the domains are often complete gibberish.\n\nThis situation looks ripe to be exploited with your favorite Cyber\u2122 Machine Learning\u00ae Big Data\u00a9 solution; and indeed, advances were made by basic language processing methods that could detect and stop the outright complete gibberish. These worked well, until DGAs mutated, and started producing more reasonable gibberish. A milestone in this regard was the introduction of KWYJIBO, a DGA that generates gibberish where every other letter is a vowel (e.\u00a0g. \u201egarolimoja\u201c), which stumps the old methods completely.\n\nHow do you thwart KWYJIBO and other DGAs of its sophistication? How do you look for meaninglessness in string-space? In this talk we\u2019ll harness the might of the English dictionary; cheat mathematics to cut running times from impossible to reasonable; and demonstrate a fancy Cyber\u2122 Machine Learning\u00ae Big Data\u00a9 tool based on all the above to tell apart meaningful domain names from nonsense.

Somewhat similar to how a social registration number creates a physical legal identity.\nWith generated names and interests, with downloaded images, these accounts have verified email addresses, and the most valuable profiles are Phone Verified Accounts, so called PVAs.\nPVAs generated with United States based phone numbers are most valuable since they are checked less by Facebook, than profiles verified with Pakistani, Bangladeshi or Filipino for example.\nThe last countries playing a big part in the artificial virtual identity industry. \nAlthough this industry has been active for many years, commodifying our idea\u2019s of what shapes an online identity, many journalists, political parties, institutions, and consumers still believe that the quantified attention of a number of likes or friends on Facebook suggests a validation of quality.\nBy collecting a large collection of custom made PVA\u2019s into an army, Dullaart is commenting on the use of these false validation systems.\nWhere PVA\u2019s are normally used for commercial gain, Dullaart will use them for performative and artistic gestures only. \nAn argument in a political conversation is suddenly liked by thousands of people, and an aspiring artist suddenly has a lot of people speaking of her work.\n\nThe newly created profiles that shape the army will be based on the identities of the 18-th century Hessian auxiliaries contracted for military service  to the British during the American revolutionary war. Using all the actual names of the mercenaries, and acting in the spirit of the army as studied by Professor Doctor Holger Gr\u00e4f, of the Hessian Historical Landes Ambt.\nThe yearly income generated by renting out the Hessian Mercenaries equaled 7 times the tax revenue of the state Hessen-Kassel, and gave Frederick II the opportunity to build many public works, amongst which the Fredericianum in Kassel, and many public roads.\nAfter the presentation of the army on the 10th of November in Kunsthalle Schirn in Frankfurt, the army will be for rent to pay for the maintenance (the profiles need rented internet proxies to keep from being killed off by Facebook) , and act under the command of Constant Dullaart and an editorial board discussing which valuable contributions the army can deliver in the political, cultural, or poetic realm on Facebook. \n\nDullaart wil show the experiences in creating and controlling the army for artistic purposes, as well as previous research into new types of digital materials for artists to use.",

        "description": "On 17th December 2014, the Government of India's Ministry of Communications and Information Technology issued an order to all licensed Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the country to block access to 32 websites, effective immediately. Not only did the ban affect access to popular cultural sites such as archive.org, vimeo.com, dailymotion.com, but the order also blocked access to sites like github.com, pastebin.com, which are useful for all sorts of people but are especially popular with software developers.\n\nThe Ministry's order was issued following a request from the Mumbai police's Anti-Terrorism Squad on 15th November 2014. The police request argued that the targeted web services were being used for \"Jihadi Propaganda\" by \"Anti-National groups\", and were encouraging youth in the country to join organisations like the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).\n\nAs a response to this, a few technologists in Berlin got together and thought it would be a good idea to do some research using free and accessible tools to look at how censorship has been implemented, as well as the various techniques that could be used to circumvent this censorship.  The research was conducted through January, 2015 and draws on the browsing experience of several customers of different ISPs around India as well as information gained through the use of the open source censorship measurement toolkit provided by Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) [1] and other manual tests we conducted. Since then, we have been able to turn this into a continued effort to monitor ISPs in India and invited others to contribute to this effort to map and understand various technical implementations of censorship orders.\n\nThis talk will summarise our key findings, including the different methods of blocking implemented by multiple ISPs.\n\nWe will also discuss and make recommendations about the different ways ISPs can better handle such censorship orders, while continuing to respect the their customers' right to access to information, and how they can be more transparent while exercising censorship orders and requests from authorities.\n\n[1] http://ooni.torproject.org/",

        "abstract": "News reports and political speeches are currently replete with references to hacking and hacktivism, i.e., politically motivated hacking. They often portray hackers and hacktivists negatively and put them onto the same level with, for example, terrorists. This talk is based on a PhD research project examining the perception of self-identified hackers and hacktivists on these (in)securitising developments. It investigates how hackers and hacktivists understand themselves and their activities, explores how they articulate the effects of this (in)securitisation, and outlines the ways they resist these processes. ",
        "description": "Within the public discourse, terms such as hacking and hacktivism are controversial. They are frequently equated with malicious activities and associated with the likes of cybercrime or cyberwarfare. Besides, both the activities and the actors standing behind these concepts are increasingly becoming subject to a threat construction. This process is understood as \u201c(in)securitisation\u201d which builds upon the idea that security issues do not necessarily reflect the objective, material circumstances of the world. Instead, what is considered as a \u201csecurity threat\u201d depends on the design of such a menace by a multitude of actors, e.g., politics, industry, or the media. \n\nThe talk uses this understanding to examine the perspective of hackers and hacktivists who have been subjected to this (in)securitisation. It is based on a sub-study which is part of a broader PhD project within the social sciences. It exhibits qualitative findings that are derived from interview data collected over the course of a Research Fellowship at the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society, Berlin. A sample of N = 35 (female: n = 6; male: n = 29) self-identified hackers and hacktivists were therefore interviewed in German or English. The data was analysed using the method of thematic analysis. \n\nThis talk explains the theoretical background of the research project, the method used to analyse the data, and presents as well as discusses some of the research\u2019s findings. It concentrates on the following issues: (a) how participants understand themselves and their activities, (b) how they articulate the effects of the (in)securitisation process, and (c) how they resist the (in)securitisation. Ultimately, the presentation gives an overview of what the (in)securitisation \u201cdoes\u201d to the hacker and hacktivist community, who - for the purpose of this research - have been studied conjunctively. It highlights how hackers\u2019 and hacktivists\u2019 self-understanding and perception stand in contrast to their current public representation, providing a relevant insight for the current debates about the possibility of re-articulating political rights online.",

Contrary to these government proposals, encryption has a critical role to play in national security by protecting citizens against malicious threats. The harm to the public that can be presented by lax digital security has been illustrated too many times: weak or flawed cryptography led to vulnerabilities such as Logjam and FREAK that compromised the transport layer security protocols used to secure network connections worldwide.

        "description": "Physical keys and locks are one of the oldest security mechanisms still employed\ntoday. Despite their long-standing history, many still suffer from known\nattacks including bumping, impressioning, teleduplication, and rights \namplification. To mitigate these attacks, many lock systems rely on restricted\nkeyways and use blanks that are not sold to the general public, making it harder\nfor attackers to obtain them. Often the key blank designs themselves are\npatented, further discouraging distribution or manufacture by even skilled\nmachinists.\n\nIn this talk, we will investigate how rapid prototyping and 3D printing tools\ncan be used to attack modern lock systems. Even when manufactured on commodity\nmachines, 3D printed keys are now good enough to be used in a variety of\nattacks. We demonstrate this by showing several example attacks against popular locks, from 3D printing the TSA master key, to our own attacks against restricted key systems. To test the strength of modern 3D printed keys, we present results from our paper of a controlled analysis on a range of printed\nmaterials from plastic to metal, and show that it is possible to cheaply make or purchase 3D printed keys that are practically as strong as real keys. We also present a tool that can automatically\ncreate a CAD model of a key blank, given only a single picture of the front of \nthe corresponding lock. This tool makes the attacks that 3D printing enables\nagainst locks even easier and cheaper by no longer requiring skilled 3D design knowledge, and provides a warning to start looking\nfor alternatives to secure physical goods. Lastly, we describe defenses\nthat modern lock manufacturers can do to ensure their locks are not easily\nbypassed by 3D printing technology, including new lock designs, as well as putting more emphasis on existing designs that may resist 3D printing-enabled attacks for years to come.\n\nWebsite: https://keysforge.com/\nPaper: https://keysforge.com/paper.html",

I spend a lot of time thinking about the way systems and AIs \u201athink\u2018 about and relate to words, context of conversations, and emotions. The way our social media systems are structured, there\u2019s a fair amount of outlining and \u201awork\u2018 users have to do when it comes to reporting online harassment, changing privacy settings, etc. But in that same vein, there's a lot the systems do for us- from suggesting users, suggesting content, to display of content, messaging, images, and events. All of those \u201athings\u2018 are coming from content created by users, and are treated as data. But what is the context of it all? Facebook can see if a user removes a relationship status, but there isn\u2019t a button or an algorithm for break ups. How do you a tell a system your child died or your heart was broken?\nThat\u2019s where the Social Media Break Up Coordinator comes in. I will perform a series of paid events for my customers, who will also sign a legally binding. These services range from untagging the user and the ex or chosen person in specific images, moving friends of the ex/person and the ex/person onto a special list (to either mute, see less content, etc), crafting a series of emotional neutral messages to alert the other person that they are being unfriended/unfollowed/blocked for specific reasons, taking the number of the ex, deleting it from the client\u2019s cellphone, and holding onto it for a specified amount of time decided upon between the client and myself. \nEffectively, the way to emotional navigate really \u201asticky\u2018 situations in social media is to have human intervention. Human emotions and relationships are complex and complicated, and require context, very deep context to understand. This is just something an algorithm cannot do. I\u2019m interested in exploring emotional labor and the creation of new digital services and job to aid in this area of human relationships that have gone awry or death, as more and more users lives are lived and shared online, especially when algorithms began to fail with this kind of content.\n\nThe talk/lecture at CCC would feature documentation of my performance, research that I\u2019ve done around blocking, muting, and a wide variety of social interactions (from abusive arguments with Gamergaters to navigating spaces with exes- ex boyfriends, girlfriends, best friends, and co-workers). I will also lecture on the structure of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram- and how the UI first fails with users when it comes to \u201ade-couple\u2018 or \u201aun-friend\u2018. I\u2019ll then lecture how the algorithms fail, because all of the interactions of these are designed towards users interacting, not users completely separating from other users who may be very connected by friends and professional networks. What is the solution for this? My hypothesis is a series of newly created human roles, almost like a freelance life couch, to help the user get their digital lives in \u201aorder\u2018. ",

In Sierra Leone, the health system was only weeks away from total collapse due to an inability to manage or pay health workers across the country and the world braced for the unchecked spread of the disease throughout west Africa. In the face of apocalyptic scenario, a company made up of local hackers took on the unprecedented challenge of building, implementing and running a huge Management Information System and Mobile payments system to keep the health system from collapsing. This talk will show how this was achieved with Open Source Software, second hand laptops, hacked voter registration machines, second hand smartphones and some very smart and determined young people used to achieving great things with none of the resources we take for granted.

This unprecedented capacity gives Facebook power to shape discourse approaching the degree of religious institutions and the state \u2013 two of the traditional institutions that we have long relied on for shaping our society-wide morality and values. \n\nBy compelling users to comply with the arbitrary content standards laid out in their ToS, Facebook is essentially laying out a new global standard for what people can and can not see. This standard, however, is not derived from the same moralistic traditions of previous moral paradigms, but is a calculated business decision crafted in the boardrooms of Silicon Valley. Risk averse, Facebook has created a global content standard that is in place not to contextualize the world for their users, but to meet perceived expectations of acceptable speech in a diverse range of nations.\n\nOur project, OnlineCensorship.org, seeks to capture instances of censorship across social media platforms.

        "subtitle": "A brief introduction to search over encrypted data",
        "abstract": "In the last couple of years, cloud and web services have become more and more popular. Since Snowden we know for sure that intelligence agencies have access to the data storage of an  service provider, either by (forced) cooperation, or espionage. Thus, to protect our privacy we have to encrypted our data before hand it over to our service provider (data holder). But this approach contradicts the very idea of a web service where the data holder have to process our data in one way or an other. Therefore, we need new cryptographic techniques to enable the  data holder to perform operation on encrypted data. One of the most important operations for cloud storage or database based web/cloud  services is the search operation.  In this talk we focus on the very familiar cloud storage scenario. Because in this scenario, It is obvious, that the user (data owner) do not want to perform the search by himself. This should be a service offered by the data holder. We will present different practical approaches to achieve searchable ciphertext, namely one with an index and one with cleverly encrypted words.\n\nNote that no PhD is required to attend this talk ;-)",
        "description": "We found that many people cannot believe that it is possible to execute operations on ciphertext.  We want to rectify this by educating hackers of the magic of searchable encryption schemes.\n\n\n\n\n<h4>Intro</h4>\n\n\"The Cloud\" has undoubtedly become very popular over the last decade.   Many people like the convenience of virtually unlimited storage and computing power at their fingertips.    However, people tend to dislike to disclose their data to third parties.   A simple solution would be encrypt the data before uploading it to a third party, but you may very well want to perform certain operations on the encrypted data such as a search.\n\n\n<h4>Entering Searchable Encryption</h4>\n\nThis conflict of encryption and the ability to execute computations on data seems to be inherent.   However, clever encryption schemes which allow certain search operations on ciphertext exist!   We  will present some searchable symmetric encryption schemes which enable others to search for keywords or substrings without learning  they key nor the plaintext.  You may very well ask what the security implications in those cases are, so we will present the associated security notions.    Another concern is performance reg. speed or memory consumption.   We present our measurements of prototypical implementations and infer that searchable symmetric encryption schemes can indeed be practical.\n\nOur vision is to store data remotely in an encrypted fashion without losing convenience of using third party applications.\nWe want to enable developers to secure their databases and we want to make users aware of advances in cryptography so that they demand more secure services.   Given the properties, other use cases of secure keyword search include email or document storage.   In fact, it is possible to not only secure relational databases, but to create secure big data scenarios where massive amounts of data are being handled.",

        "abstract": "The leading social networks are the powerful new gatekeepers of the digital age. Proprietary de facto standards of the dominant companies have lead to the emergence of virtual \u201cinformation silos\u201d that can barely communicate with one another. Has Diaspora really lost the war? Or is there still a chance to succeed?",
        "description": "The Internet today is a giant web, a hilarious copy machine, interlaced into more and more aspects of our lives. What started as a network of equal nodes, has since transformed the layer above the open, decentralized hypertext protocol, and begun to move it towards greater centralization and power in the hands of few large platforms. Social networks are an important benchmark for this trend. \n\nSocial networks are an important tool for private, commercial and political use. Technological sovereignty can be decisive for political struggles, regardless of whether we talk about elections or revolutions. Privacy gains importance when the Internet becomes interconnected with more and more parts of our lives. The launch of Diaspora in 2010, a crowdfunded free-to-use social network based on free software, was clearly born from these debates. While the appeal of a federated system of social contacts is same in centralized and decentralized networks, they are worlds apart regarding their technical infrastructure, their power structures and their options for business models. \n\nMuch scientific work has been carried out on the technical challenges that decentralized social networks face. But the underlying economic mechanisms that drive the market towards concentration, promote the dominance of few actors and build high barriers for market entry, have so far been rarely addressed in the context of social networks. The dominance of one network is deeply rooted in the code of the market structure troubled with network effects, lock-in and proprietary de facto standards. Furthermore, privacy restraints through the operator derive from the very core of the business model of multi-sided markets as a bottleneck between users and advertisers. Lock-in and switching costs, make it difficult for users to leave their social network, thereby weakening competition. Such a structure enforces asymmetric power relations between users and providers systematically.  \n\nHere\u2019s the thesis: Whoever wants to challenge the incumbent\u2019s position needs to address these findings since this structure poses high barriers for market entry. Centralization of infrastructure on the market for social networks can not be reversed with technology alone. Decentralized social networks need foremost to consider how to breathe life into their provided infrastructure, since it is the user content and the interconnection between users that adds value and meaning to a social network. Projects that want to reintroduce technological sovereignty need good technology combined with a straightforward strategy for market entry. Some of these strategies differ substantially from standard strategies, since non-commercialized decentralized community driven projects based on the idea of free/ libre open source software differ in many aspects from companies. The fact that Diaspora built an alliance with other decentralized social networks of the Federation based on shared open standards is an important development and can be regarded as a good move towards joining forces against a paramount incumbent. It will be shown that although decentralized social networks face tough conditions entering the market for social networks, there are promising strategies that have not yet been exhausted. \n\nThe controversies which arose around the centralization in the market for social networks are now more pressing than ever. This talk shall present an overview of the impact of social networks and the driving economic forces of this market. The status quo of the Diaspora network and the Federation as the most prominent representative of free and open source non-commercial decentralized alternatives will be analyzed. Next, the economic analysis of the relevant market structures will be used to derive fresh perspectives on how this \u201cnew kid on the block\u201d could develop a strategy for a successful market entry. The findings are supported by expert interviews with authorities in relevant fields and data from Diaspora and connected networks.",

        "description": "My very subjective views to the following projects I got myself more or less involved\nThe Mooltipass is a offline passwordstorage with 2 factor authentification, which is a open hardware development initiat around the hackaday community. Here I did simply crwodfunding, which is surely the easiest way to support open hardware. Untill it looks like the campagin is missing the goal and what you can do about it and what are good ways to set up perks.\nThe Openpandor and its successor the Pyra are chamshell designe mini handhelds mainly aimed for (retro)gaming, but also have the power to run as full Linux desktop PC. Here I give a view from what the whole community and the maker learned, including surviving the near death of the whole project and how you should/should not tread the community. Endurance will earn awsomeness.\nThe Senoko is the Novena Battery Board, which is easily producable, because it's open hardware, right? Why it is and is not somehow at the same time, why I started it alltogether and how to make it happen inspite of strange standardisation, customs and confusing notifications on your account statement.\nAnd my peronal dos and don'ts that derivate from this expierence.",

My own personal independent research of the Chinese internet and the popular Chinese social app, WeChat \u5fae\u4fe1, has contributed to an ongoing massive archive I began in 2014 called The Chinternet Archive. To date, I have over 15,000 pieces of content (and growing) documenting localized trends, memes, vernacular photography, online personas, .gif animations, videos, selfies, propaganda, retail, family/work life, and other such digital artifacts of online Chinese culture. This archive directly influenced my artistic and curatorial practice, resulting in an online art collection called Netize.net, or its Chinese name of \u7f51\u53cb\u7f51 [w\u01cengy\u01d2uw\u01ceng] \u201cInternet Friend Network\u201d, which collaborates with emerging Chinese and international artists who are exploring or deconstructing East/West dichotomies, engaging in Sino-centric Web aesthetics, or investigating the East online.

        "description": "Michelle Lee Proksell \u5a9a\u6f47 (b. 1985, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia) was born a Third Culture Kid (TCK) to ex-patriate American parents and experienced extreme forms of censorship and governmental monitoring in Saudi Arabia during her formative years. This influenced and shaped her interest and direction in exploring transcultural experiences online in relationship to localized access and dissemination of information, via forms of censorship or self-censorship. Her childhood exploring Asia and years working in new media and internet-related galleries and projects led to her eventual fascination with the unique history of the Chinese Internet. Since 2012 she has been working with creatives in China who engage in technology and the internet, resulting in two major projects documenting online digital artifacts and the emergence of Net Art in China:  The Chinternet Archive and Netize.net \u7f51\u53cb\u7f51 \u201cThe Internet Friend Network\u201d.\n\nIn this lecture, Michelle will briefly introduce Chinese digital media and online culture through her first hand experience and research. She will touch upon the topics of what it\u2019s really like to deal with the Great Fire Wall on a daily basis, the influence of WeChat on contemporary Chinese digital culture, creative trends from her Chinternet Archive, and memes pertaining to recent viral media events. She will also introduce artists and their artworks from her Netize.net \u7f51\u53cb\u7f51 project. She will reflect on how people are engaging creatively with the changes of the Chinese internet, how this influences artists and what we can learn from localized networks and the increasingly blurred lines between real life and virtual life.\n",

Each service, called unikernel,  is an OCaml application using libraries such as a TCP/IP stack, DNS. It is either compiled to a Xen virtual machine image or to a Unix binary (for development). State in 2014 is that it runs on x86 and arm, we implemented a clean-slate TLS (1.0, 1.1, 1.2), X.509, ASN.1 stack, crypto primitives, Off-the-record. We also have TCP/IP, HTTP, a persistent branchable store (similar to git) - all implemented in OCaml. A virtual machine serving data via https is roughly 2MB in size - no libc inside :)",
        "description": "Mirage OS is a (BSD-licensed) research project at University of Cambridge and released in December 2013 a 1.0 version. In 2014, 2.0 got released with full support on arm, a clean-slate TLS implementation, and the branchable data store Irmin. We (Hannes and David) developed a TLS stack from scratch (including cryptographic primitives, X.509, ASN.1), which we will present.\n\nWe intentionally breaks with the UNIX philosophy. Instead of using a programming language designed to replace platform-specific assembly code we use the functional programming language OCaml with higher-order functions, a composable module system, pattern matching, a sophisticated type system. Our developed TLS stack separates side effects, such as mutable memory, network input and output, etc., clearly from the pure functional core. This separation is not enforced on a language level, but by convention.\n\nA mirage unikernel runs either as a Xen guest or as native Unix application. Each unikernel runs in a single address space, and does not include layers over layers of abstraction (kernel, user space, file system, processes, language runtime, threads, ...). The performance is not too bad (see link below). Each unikernel only uses those libraries it really needs - e.g. a name server does not depend on a file system or user accounts. A common unikernel is rather small in binary size: a web server, including TCP/IP stack and the data to be served, is less than a megabyte in size, including the OCaml runtime. There is no libc included :)\n\nModularity is the key for Mirage OS: the same application code can be compiled as a UNIX executable using the POSIX socket API, or as UNIX program using the userspace tun/tap interface and the TCP/IP stack written in OCaml, or as a Xen domU. This eases development, testing, debugging, and deployment.\n\nOur target platform is the cubieboard2, a small board with a dual-core ARM A7 CPU and ethernet (and various other unused interfaces).\n\nCode reviews, comments, contributions are always welcome.",

        "description": "16 years ago, Daniel Bleichenbacher presented a protocol-level padding oracle attack against SSL/TLS. As a countermeasure, all TLS RFCs starting from RFC 2246 (TLS 1.0) propose \"to treat incorrectly formatted messages in a manner indistinguishable from correctly formatted RSA blocks\".\n\nIn our recent paper [1] we show that this objective has not been achieved yet: We present four new Bleichenbacher side channels, and three successful Bleichenbacher attacks against the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) SSL/TLS implementation and against hardware security appliances using the Cavium NITROX SSL accelerator chip. Three of these side channels are timing-based, and two of them provide the first timing-based Bleichenbacher attacks on SSL/TLS described in the literature. Our measurements confirmed that all these side channels are observable over a switched network, with timing differences between 1 and 23 microseconds. We were able to successfully recover the PreMasterSecret using three of the four side channels in a realistic measurement setup.\n\nBesides the academic relevance of breaking common SSL/TLS implementations, the timing attacks we performed are quite interesting for the hacking community. In our talk, we will thus focus on the challenges we had to solve during our attacks and on the challenges of fixing these issues.\n\nThe talk extends the topics that I presented at 28c3 [2] and 29c3 [3].\n\n[1]: Revisiting SSL/TLS Implementations: New Bleichenbacher Side Channels and Attacks.\nMeyer, Somorovsky, Weiss, Schwenk, Schinzel, Tews.\nUsenix Security Symposium 2014.\n[2]: https://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2011/28c3-4640-en-time_is_on_my_side.html\n[3]: https://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2012/29c3-5044-en-time_is_not_on_your_side_h264.html",

Every now and then, you hear it thrown around as a possible attack vector - perhaps to aid in reverse-engineering efforts, or to understand an unknown cryptographic implementation. But what is glitching, exactly? And, more importantly, how can it be leveraged as a potentially powerful tool?\n\nThis presentation chronicles a quest to learn what types of electrical transients can be introduced into an integrated circuit to cause a variety of circuit faults advantageous to an reverser. Several hardware platforms were constructed during the quest to aid in research, including old-skool & solderless breadboards, photo-etched & professional PCBs, FPGAs, and cheap & dirty homemade logic analyzers. The strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches will be discussed.\n\nInstead of covering a hypothetical \"toy\" implementation of a victim chip - such as where the researcher/reverser implements a cryptographic algorithm themselves as software in a common microcontroller, and then attempts to glitch the implementation - a successful blackbox attack against a production security IC will be discussed, including how the attack was mounted, how results were obtained, and approaches to interpret the results.\n\nDespite claims of its obsolescence, electrical glitching can be a viable attack vector against a variety of ICs, with a notable exception being some ultra-modern purpose-built security ICs. It is cheap to perform, you don't need an expensive laboratory, and if done properly, is non-destructive in nature. Glitching should be another tool in the reverser's arsenal, and can potentially provide results when other approaches have failed.",

        "abstract": "Programs are full of bugs, leading to vulnerabilities. We'll discuss power and limitations of code-pointer integrity (CPI), a strong but practical security policy that enforces memory safety for all code pointers, protecting against any form of control-flow hijack attack (e. g., ROP or JOP).\n",
        "description": "Systems code is often written in low-level languages like C/C++, which offer many benefits but also delegate memory management to programmers. This invites memory safety bugs that attackers can exploit to divert control flow and compromise the system. Deployed defence mechanisms (e. g., ASLR, DEP) are incomplete, and stronger defence mechanisms (e. g., CFI) often have high overhead and limited guarantees (and are therefore not generally deployed).\n\nIn this talk we discuss code-pointer integrity (CPI), a strong security policy that guarantees the integrity of all code pointers in a program (e.g., function pointers, saved return addresses) and thereby prevents all control-flow hijack attacks, including return-oriented programming and jump-oriented programming. We also introduce code-pointer separation (CPS), a relaxation of CPI with better performance properties. Both CPI and CPS offer substantially better\nsecurity-to-overhead ratios than the state of the art, they are practical (we protect a complete FreeBSD system and over 100 packages like apache and postgresql), effective (prevent all attacks in the RIPE benchmark), and efficient, resulting in very low to negligible performance overhead.\n\nWe will also discuss technical challenges in the CPI prototype implementation, practical challenges we faced when protecting a full FreeBSD distribution, and give more details on the scope of protection which will be interesting to hackers.  The full prototype implementation is open-source, all changes to FreeBSD are open-source and we're working on integrating the patches into LLVM.",

These are drafted in terms which discriminate the privacy rights you have by the passport you hold - in fact there are no rights at all for non-Americans outside the US.\nIt is obvious that this is a reasonably important dimension of the whole Snowden affair, because it starkly conflicts with ECHR norms that rights are universal and equal.\nThe only possible resolution compatible with universal rights is data localization, or construction of a virtual zone in which countries have agreed mutual verifiable inspections that mass-surveillance is not occurring (and at present this seems unlikely). There is a widespread misconception that somehow the new GDPR privacy regulation will curb foreign spying, when in fact it is designed to widen loopholes into floodgates.\nThis talk is multidisciplinary and will cover national and international surveillance and privacy law, Five Eyes SIGINT policy, technical security and economics.",

They are named after the Scottish physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell, who published those equations exactly 150 years ago and form the foundation of classical electrodynamics. Actually Maxwell had 20 equations and it took another 20 years until they were understood and the self-taught British engineer,  mathematician, and physicist Heaviside put the equations in their present form. Some years later Hertz brought the experimental prove of Maxwell's theory.\n\nUnder a lot of simplifying boundary conditions wave propagation and antenna theory can be derived from this four equations. This talk will lead from Maxwell's equations to wave equations and nice antenna forms and arrays. Also some practical aspects will be evaluated. Why do low frequencies reach farther than higher frequencies? Why do radio astronomers spread their antenna arrays over whole continents? Or why is China Mobile building antenna arrays for mobile radio consisting of 128 antennas?  \n",

The hyperme model links the user identities created across different services and the features associated with them. These features are attributes that compose an identity, such as email, date of birth, place of birth and so on.\n\nThe hyperme model of the user identity permits the visualisation of the user expressed preferences, the content they have created and who or what can access this content.\nThe model uses context between the user\u2019s various identities and the signals produced, to create links between different objects, obtaining an explorable graph\u00ad-like structure.\nLinks between data snippets are creating by exploring the keywords and categories used to describe the entities. These are provided by the user themselves through freeform annotations, particular use of language, location information, timestamps, social relationships and association with other entities such as companies and institutions.\n\nExplicit connections are also discovered by associating such keywords with Wikipedia concepts. By exploiting links between articles, it is possible to draw relations between different entities, providing a dictionary to build strong connections between different categories.\n\nIf the identities created by a single user, and the signals generated are analysed at different levels, it would be possible to discover different subgraphs and sub\u00adhypergraphs between the data object, therefore revealing a complex network of heterogeneous information shared across a number of services and with sets of different parties, being this social relationships or other applications and devices.\nEach party in fact enjoys a certain level of access to the different documents produced by the user, by the devices used and by the application authorised to access and produce content on their behalf.\n\nA hypergraph model therefore allows the possibility to explore the user\u2019s different identities and the corresponding created content at different levels, exposing how different services or relationships contribute to protect or threaten the user privacy.",

        "description": "All large, feature-rich and complex frameworks suck. True, but too short for a talk. Therefore the talk tries to make a point on why one should still us these frameworks (for robotics). At least so, if one wants to have fun with (home/hackerspace) robotics and do something cool, instead of getting stuck at the usual \"trivial\" (or low-level, sounds less judging) capabilities.\n\nIn order to build robots one needs at least a basic understanding of mechanics, electronics and computer science. Obviously, more advanced robot features in each area, depend on more advanced roboticist skills \u2013 and equipment ... and money. The growing community of makers, the proliferation of hackerspaces (cooperators, equipment!) and highly useful consumer devices lessen the hardware related challenges. On the other hand, state-of-the-art open-source robotics software has been available for quite a few years already. Unfortunately, it is still somewhat neglected by the extended, i. e. non-academic, robotics community. The mindset and prejudices of too many hackerspace natives is opposed to using preexisting frameworks, especially large ones, in favor of starting from scratch. Bloat, ugly APIs, deprecated programming styles and of course bad code conventions ... good and good enough reasons to start over (I confess, too!). As a result many projects never get beyond the point of \"finally fixed the bug by reflashing the microcontroller with code that sets register bar42=0xf00, now it moves \u2013 sort of\".\n\nThe famous \"Re-inventing the Wheel\" comic (http://www.willowgarage.com/sites/default/files/blog/201004/willow_p1_02s.jpg) posted by Willow Garage in 2010, does tell the life cycle of robotics in the PhD world, but not only that. Rather, unfortunately, it pertains to robotic and closely related projects in general.\n\nSo in a nutshell, yet another 'Introduction to ROS' talk? Yes, an introduction to the Robot Operating System (ROS).\nHowever, for once without leaving behind the impression (in the hobbyists mind) that this is all cool stuff, but what to do with it when not owning a 100K dollar robot.\nThe goal is to show a few basics (the Plumbing), as many of the tools and capabilities as time permits and a few words about the people side of things.\n(http://www.ros.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ros_equation.png)\nShould the robot visually perceive the world? ROS + Webcam(s) / Kinect / Xtion. Hello, out of the box drivers, calibration, point clouds and object recognition.\nShould the robot drive around and navigate in the environment? ROS + Navigation stack. Hello, out of the box SLAM.\nShould the robot reach out and grasp something? ROS + MoveIt!. Hello, out of the box collision-free motion planning.\nShould the robot brain be distributed across multiple computers without changing a line of code? ROS. Hello, out of the box usable(!) middleware.\nShould the robot builders be able to create independent, yet compatible modules? ROS. Hello, out of the box modularity (well ok \u2013 at least kind of).\nShould the robot's world be easily understandable through interactive visualizations? ROS + Rviz / rqt. Hello, out of the box advanced 3D visualization for many types of data.\nIs this an advertisement? Yes, for great open source software \u2013 to make each of your lines of code do more _interesting_ stuff. Hello ROS world.",

        "description": "Humanoid robots fascinate us - they appear in nearly every science fiction universe. Compared to Mr. Data or C-3PO, humanoids in reality are rather disappointing. Not only do they lack anything resembling human-level intelligence, but even their walking is slow and fragile - most of them only work on perfectly even ground. While we still have to wait a long time for true artificial intelligence, the recent years have brought substantial progress with respect to motion.\n\nUnfortunately, most of that progress is proprietary - the leading groups, such as Schaft and Boston Dynamics, publish very little beyond Youtube videos. University projects are more open, but still usually do not publish source code or construction drawings. We think that bipedal robots are way too important to be left to the proprietary world, so we decided to learn from what is available and start to build our own, completely open one. In the talk, we will try to share what we have learned so far.\n\nThe first part of the talk will be on simulation, which allows us to test control algorithms and to get an idea about the mechanical requirements without having to build actual hardware. We will introduce the basics of rigid body dynamics, discuss the physics of walking and show how a successful walking machine can be built, at least a virtual one.\n\nIn the second part of the talk, we will discuss how a physical, human-size robot might be built without needing a 100,000+ \u20ac budget. We will present our plans and experiments on sensors, motor drivers and actuators.",

Da sind sich alle einig, und es wird viel dar\u00fcber gesprochen. Doch die gro\u00dfe Bildungsinitiative l\u00e4sst auf sich warten, und Nachwuchstalente werden gesellschaftlich noch immer wenig beachtet und noch seltener aktiv gef\u00f6rdert. \n\nWir von der gemeinn\u00fctzigen Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland e.V. wollten nicht l\u00e4nger warten und haben deswegen 2013 das F\u00f6rderprogramm Jugend hackt ins Leben gerufen. Zuletzt kamen im September 2014 rund 120 Jugendliche aus ganz Deutschland in Berlin zusammen. Gemeinsam mit Gleichgesinnten haben sie an Software- und Hardwareprojekten rund um die Themen \u00dcberwachung, Bildung, Gesundheit, Gesellschaft, Freizeit und Umwelt gearbeitet. \n\nDie Jugendlichen, die zwischen 12 und 18 Jahre alt sind, entwickelten insgesamt 27 Projekte, mit denen sie ein deutliches Statement gegen das beliebte Narrativ der politisch desinteressierten Jugend setzten. Sie zeigten nicht nur, dass sie technisch versiert und kreativ mit Computern umgehen konnten, sondern auch einen wachsamen und kritischen Blick auf gesellschaftliche und politische Herausforderungen haben. Alle 27 Projektideen sind selbstst\u00e4ndig von den Jugendlichen erarbeitet und umgesetzt worden. F\u00fcr Fragen standen den Jugendlichen erwachsene Softwareentwickler/innen zur Seite.\n\nAuf dem 31c3 wollen wir unsere Erfahrungen mit euch teilen. Zudem werden Teilnehmer von Jugend hackt ihre entstandenen Projekte vorstellen. Da ist z.B. \"Awearness\", ein Armband, das vibriert, wenn eine \u00dcberwachungskamera in der N\u00e4he ist.

More than pure analysis of vulnerability, this map rates and ranks the vulnerability of countries and operators showing discrepancies in the level and type of protection: SCCP screening, SS7 policing, MAP filtering, rate limiting, Network Element security configurations.

While these vulnerabilities have been responsibly disclosed to the vendors, SCADA/ICS patching in live environments tends to take 1-3 years. At least three vendors switches will be examined: Siemens, GE, Garrettcom. \n\nTherefore, this presentation matters to any hackers or anarchists, who believe they have a right to examine the resilience and security of the  infrastructures that support their communities.\n\nOwn your own critical infrastructures today!\n",

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "Estonia is the only country in the world that relies on Internet voting in a significant way for legally-binding national elections \u2014 up to 30% of all voters cast their ballots online. This makes the security of Estonia's Internet voting system of interest to technologists and citizens the world over. Over the past year, I helped lead the first rigorous, independent security evaluation of the system, based on election observation, code review, and laboratory testing. The findings are alarming: there are staggering gaps in Estonia's procedural and operational security, and the architecture of the system leaves it open to cyberattacks from foreign powers. Our investigation confirmed the viability of these attacks in the lab, but the Estonian government has chosen to downplay them. We urgently recommend that Estonia discontinue use of the system before the country suffers a major attack.",
        "description": "When Estonia introduced its online voting system in 2005, it became the first country to offer Internet voting nationally. Today, people around the world look to Estonia's example, and some wonder why they can't vote online too. Nevertheless, the system remains controversial.  While many Estonians view Internet voting as a source of national pride, one major political party has repeatedly called for it to be abandoned.\n\nOver the past year, I took part in the first rigorous and fully independent security analysis of the Estonian Internet voting system. My team observed operations during the October 2013 and May 2014 elections, conducted interviews with the system developers and election officials, assessed the software through source code review and reverse engineering, and performed tests on a reproduction of the complete system in our lab.\n\nThe threats facing national elections have shifted significantly since the Estonian system was designed more than a decade ago. State-level cyberattacks, once a largely hypothetical threat, has become a well documented reality, and attacks by foreign states are now a credible threat to a national online voting system. To test the feasibility of such attacks, we reproduced the I-voting system and played the role of a sophisticated attacker during a mock election. We developed client-side attacks that silently steal votes on voters' own computers  We also demonstrated server-side attacks that target introduce malware into the vote counting server, allowing a foreign power or dishonest insider to shifting results in favor of their preferred candidate.\n\nThese risks are even more serious because of deviations from procedure and serious lapses in operational security that we observed during real elections.  Election workers downloaded security-critical software over unsecured Internet connections, typed server root passwords in full view of observers and public video cameras, and prepared election software for distribution to the public on insecure personal computers, among other examples. These actions indicate a dangerously inadequate level of professionalism in security administration that leaves the whole system open to attack and manipulation.\n\nWhen we made our study public in Estonia, government responses ranged from dismissive to absurd. Officials discounted them, and the President and Prime Minister insinuated that we had been bought off by a rival political party. We hope that the country can separate technical reality from politics in time to avert a major attack. For other countries that are considering adopting Internet voting, we hope that the weaknesses of the Estonian system can be an important cautionary lesson.",

        "subtitle": "How governments use censorship and surveillance  as part of their violent repressive tactics",
        "abstract": "Simple access to social media and cell phone has widely been accepted as a positive tool for citizens to voice dissatisfaction with their government and coordinate protest. But why would rulers permit these tools if they merely pose a threat to their own survival? This talk will investigate how a government\u2019s ability to censor and limit the flow of information feeds into its choice of violent responses to protest. I will talk about the conditions under which a government is likely to benefit more from surveilling the free flow of information, and under which conditions it is more likely to benefit from censorship. \n",
        "description": "A few weeks before the first mass protests ensued across Syria in March 2011, the Regime led by President Bashar Al-Assad lifted a large number of bans on social networking platforms, including Facebook and Youtube. Up to that point, the Regime had controlled the most regulated media landscape and telecommunications market in the Middle East, which is why the move towards providing access to social media sites not even permitted in China was not something to be expected. Why, after all these years of extreme censorship, does a government suddenly permit free access to, and generation of, information? \nThe ability to connect via large social network platforms has been celebrated as an important way for ordinary citizens to collectively organise protest in light of repressive rulers. The revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa have spurred a new and important research area on the effects of digital communication technology on citizen\u2019s propensity to voice dissent and organise protest and resistance. The fact that anyone with a working network connection can now access, generate, and exchange content on the internet has been termed a \u2018game changer\u2019 for authoritarian regimes intent on maintaining control in light of mass popular protest. \nWhat has remained largely unanswered, is how regimes resolved to stay in power can make use of their ability to surveil, censor, and limit the flow of information in an age where the majority of communication has been relegated to the inter- net and mobile phones. Understanding the way in which this new form of control feeds into more traditional means of repression, such as the use of extreme forms of physical coercion, is a crucial part of this process. In this talk, I will discuss under which conditions the free flow of information is likely to prove helpful in conducting effective state repression, and under which conditions the censoring of information access is likely to be more beneficial. \nRegimes intent on maintaining power against all adversaries have long since combined the use of censorship with physical violations of those deemed threatening to their position. The introduction of digital communication technology has, however, altered the costs and benefits of limiting the flow of information when conducting coercive campaigns. When Syria\u2019s government decided to unblock social networking sites, it might thus have simultaneously increased its intelligence for counterinsurgency operations, while also providing new ways of collective action for the opposition. Investigating these changes and how they affect the tactics of state violence is a crucial first step in understanding how contemporary and future governments are likely to incorporate their control of communication technology into strategies of repression.\nI use supervised machine-learning to analyze over 60,000 records of killings perpetrated by the Syrian Regime in the ongoing conflict, and classify them according to their event circumstances, to arrive at a categorization between targeted and untargeted acts of repression. I find that higher levels of information accessibility are consistently linked to an increase in the proportion of targeted repression, whereas areas with little or no access witness more indiscriminate campaigns of violence. \n",

        "subtitle": "A Lawful Method for Converting Closed IP into Open IP",
        "abstract": "We introduce Fernvale, a reverse-engineered, open hardware and software platform based upon Mediatek's MT6260 value phone SoC. The MT6260 is the chip that powers many of the $10 GSM feature phones produced by the Shanzhai. \n\nFernvale is made available as open-licensed schematics, board layouts, and an RTOS based upon the BSD-licensed NuttX, as well as a suite of open tools for code development and firmware upload. We discuss our technical reverse engineering efforts, as well as our methodology to lawfully import IP from the Shanzhai ecosystem into the Maker ecosystem. We hope to establish a repeatable, if not labor-intensive, model for opening up previously closed IP of interest, thereby outlining a path to leveling the playing field for lawful Makers.\n",
        "description": "There is a set of technology which Makers are legally allowed access, and there is a much larger set of technology which is used to make our every day gadgets. Access to the best closed-source technology is prevented via barriers such as copyright (limiting your ability to learn how it works), patent (limiting your ability to make something similar), and supply-chain (limiting your ability to buy it). As a result, open-licensed, Maker-friendly technologies have trailed closed-source technology in terms of cost, performance, and features. \n\nMakers operating under Western IP law are legally bound by these barriers, and are forced to settle for Arduinos, Beaglebones, Raspberry Pis and Novenae. However, all of these are a far cry in terms of cost, performance, and features from what consumers typically expect from boxes purchased in retail stores. \n\nOur research into the Chinese ecosystem indicates there is another way. Originally marginalized as outlaws and copycats, the Shanzhai of China \u2013 China's counterpart to the Western hacker-maker \u2013 exist in a realm where copyright and patent barriers are permeable, a state which we refer to as 'gongkai'. As a result, knowledge and access to state of the art closed source technology has diffused into the Shanzhai ecosystem. Today, they have moved beyond the rote copying of Nokia, Samsung, and Apple, and have created a thriving, vibrant ecosystem where mobile technology is rip/mix/burned; their products are mass-produced at a rate of millions per month for the \u201crest of the world\u201d, e.g. emerging markets such as Africa, Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Russia. \n\nAbout a year ago, we did a tear-down of an example $12 phone, and contrasted it to the Arduino Uno. For $29, the Arduino Uno gets you a 16MHz, 8-bit CPU with 2.5k of RAM, and USB plus a smattering of GPIO as the sole interfaces. For $12, a phone out of the Chinese gongkai ecosystem gets you a 260 MHz, 32-bit CPU with 8MiB of RAM, with USB, microSD, SIM, quad-band GSM, Bluetooth, an OLED display and a battery. It begs the question of why, when Makers talk about IoT technologies in the West, they typically think of wifi-powered solutions in the $20-70 range, versus a GSM platform in the $10-$20 range. \n\nIn this lecture, we disclose an attempt to short-circuit the disclosure barrier. We are releasing an open hardware and software solution built around the Mediatek MT6260. The MT6260 is a 32-bit ARM7EJ-S SoC with 8MiB of PSRAM in-package, as well as USB, LCD, touchscreen, audio, Bluetooth, quad-band GSM, dual-SIM, FM radio, UART, keypad, SD card, camera, and other peripherals integrated. The chip can be purchased on the over-the-counter market for about $2-3 in China. We call our solution built around this chip \u201cFernvale\u201d. \n\nFernvale is similar to the \u201cLinkIt ONE\u201d recently released by Mediatek and Seeed Studios, based upon the MT2502A SoC and targeted at IoT and wearables. LinkIt indicates a new direction for Mediatek and we are optimistic that their effort indicates a new pattern of openness toward Makers. At the time of this proposal's submission, the details of the LinkIt ONE platform are still unfolding, but the basic feature set looks comparable to that of Fernvale. However, it seems the LinkIt SDK is still based upon a closed-source Nucleus RTOS providing services to an open Arduino-like API.\n\nUnlike LinkIt ONE, Fernvale runs a port of NuttX, a small-footprint BSD-licensed RTOS that is Posix and ANSI compliant, and includes a partial set of drivers for the available hardware peripherals. The mainboard is laid out to function as either a SoM (system on module) or as a truncated Arduino shield (with the appropriate headers populated), and focuses on the computational abilities of the platform. In other words, Fernvale is not positioned as a mobile phone solution per se, but rather as an Engineering Development Kit (EDK) for embedded applications that can benefit from a highly-integrated, low-cost high-performance microcontroller solution such as the MT6260. As a result, the mainboard breaks out a selection of GPIO as well as the speaker, battery, USB, and SD card interfaces. The mainboard also serves as a base platform for rallying a larger community of developers who can aid with the task of reverse engineering and writing legally open drivers for its massive peripheral set. \n\nTwo expansion headers are provided on the mainboard. A larger UX header can be used to attach a keypad + LCD + audio interface, for applications that require UI elements. A smaller analog header enables users to attach an RF front-end of their choosing, which could potentially enable GSM-compatible voice and data services, if drivers were to exist.\n\nThis lecture will also discuss our experiences reverse engineering, and our approach to open-sourcing the MT6260. We had to reverse engineer significant portions of the system, including but not limited to circuit board layouts, hardware configuration options, bootloader protocols, partial register maps, and the internal boot ROM of the SoC. This reverse engineering effort was necessary to create a blob-free software implementation, and to give developers an alternative to  Mediatek's proprietary firmware flashing utilities to upload code. It was also necessary to create schematics and circuit board maskworks which have an original copyright thereby giving us the right to pick an open license for the hardware designs. \n\nWe took special pains to ensure our method was lawful and the resulting work is copyright-clean under U.S. law. We did review some non-open-licensed chip documentation and code examples available for download from open file-sharing sites. None of these materials were restricted by DRM. American copyright law contains a fair-use exception that allows limited copying and examination of such materials for the purpose of understanding the ideas and functional concepts embodied in them. We believe our download and review of those materials is fair use. Should potential copyright holders disagree with our interpretation, we invite any offended parties to engage us in rational discourse.\n\nWe believe that Makers have for too long lived in the shadow of overbearing copyright laws. We need to develop an example of how to import ideas from less strict IP jurisdictions where innovation is flourishing; failing this, hardware Makers run the risk of being eternally behind the Shanzhai. Fernvale is our first attempt at developing a legal context for importing IP from the gongkai ecosystem into a fully open source solution; we hope our example will embolden other developers to pursue more ambitious targets. We also hope our work may, in the long term, catalyze meaningful Maker-friendly reform to Western IP law by raising awareness of the disparity between East and West, with the success of the Shanzhai serving as evidence of how permissive IP policy can be good for both grass-roots innovators (the Shanzhai) and big businesses (Mediatek and the phone network operators) alike.\n",

The vulnerability was one of the most consequential in the history of the Internet, since it allowed attackers to potentially steal login credentials, cryptographic keys, and other private data from up to half of all popular HTTPS sites.  In this talk, we take a detailed look at Heartbleed and its aftermath, based on comprehensive measurements and analysis that our research team performed over the past six months.  We began tracking Heartbleed's impact within hours of its disclosure using massive ZMap scans and large network telescopes.  This allowed us to track which sites remained vulnerable, observe certificate revocations, and monitor for large scale attacks in close to real time. Based on this data, we also conducted one of the largest ever mass vulnerability notifications, informing the network administrators for all devices still susceptible to Heartbleed across the entire IPv4 address space.  Finally, we investigated the question of whether attackers knew about and exploited Heartbleed prior to its public disclosure---and we will present new details about this question in the talk.  We hope that by learning from the Heartbleed security disaster, our community can prepare to respond more effectively to such events in the future. ",
        "description": "<p>In March 2014, researchers found a catastrophic vulnerability in OpenSSL, the cryptographic library used to secure connections in popular servers including Apache and Nginx. The bug allowed attackers to extract cryptographic keys, login credentials, and other private data from an estimated 22-55% of HTTPS sites. Worsening its severity, the bug was both simple to understand and exploit.</p>\n\n<p>We used ZMap to perform comprehensive scans of the IPv4 address space and popular web servers in the days and months following disclosure. We provide more extensive estimates on who was originally vulnerable, track who patched their sites, and replaced certificates. We will present exactly which server products and devices were vulnerable. We will further discuss how Heartbleed affected the HTTPS CA ecosystem. Worryingly, we find that only 10% of the known vulnerable sites replaced their certificates within the next month, and of those that did, 14% neglected to change the private key, gaining no protection from certificate replacement! We'll also present the shortcomings in the public key infrastructure that Heartbleed unearthed and problems our community needs to focus on moving forward.</p>\n\n<p>We investigated widespread attempts to exploit Heartbleed post disclosure at four network sites. We will discuss the subsequent exploit attempts we observed from almost 700 sources and the Internet-wide scans that started post disclosure. We also investigated whether exploit attempts took place prior to Heartbleed's public disclosure, including examining suspicious network traces recorded months earlier.  We will disclose new details of these traces and their implications in the talk.</p>\n\n<p>Even with global publicity, Heartbleed patching plateaued after two weeks. To try to help, we notified network administrators responsible for more than 500,000 unpatched systems. While much of the security community (including us!) assumed that mass vulnerability notifications would be too difficult or ineffective, we found that it increased the Heartbleed patching rate by nearly 50%.  We will discuss how we performed these notifications, the reactions of network operators, and prospects for performing automatic mass notifications based on Internet-wide scanning in future vulnerability events.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the talk, we will use real world data to frame what went well and what went poorly in the Internet's response to Heartbleed. The vulnerability's severe risks, widespread impact, and costly global cleanup qualify it as a security disaster. However, by understanding what went wrong and learning from it, the Internet security community can be better prepared to address major security failures in the future.</p>",

        "subtitle": "The untold story of what really happened, how it was patched and what was learned.",
        "abstract": "Two weeks after the Heartbleed bug was announced, CloudFlare patched the Heartbleed bug, created a challenge to prove the bug could be used to find private keys (uncovering a second bug in OpenSSL) and turned its entire network into a giant honeypot. This session will discuss the specific steps taken to prevent early disclosure, creating and scaling the first public vulnerability test, how the CloudFlare Heartbleed challenge showed that you can reveal private SSL keys (how a second bug in OpenSSL made this possible) the incredible impact of revoking over 100,000 certificates in a single day, and the results of our honeypot revealing the proportion of attack traffic versus research traffic. ",
        "description": "CloudFlare was notified about Heartbleed as soon as it was discovered--ahead its public announcement--and took extreme precaution to not reveal anything about the bug. This required communicating only over secure channels, restricting the visibility of the branch from which we built the workaround, and using secure software deployment methods.\n\nAfter the patch was announced, there was a rush to reverse engineer the bug and create an exploit. The cloudFlare team immediately started working proof of concept, and hosted it on a website allowing others to scan for vulnerable sites. Within minutes, the original site was flooded with requests. CloudFlare\u2019s Nick Sullivan will share this process and the feats pulled off to make sure the site could scale and provide accurate results. He will go into the numbers and technical details of the PoC and speak about its bugs and how they were found. Statistics and anonymized raw data of the 70+ millions of results will be provided, giving an overview of the patching process over time.\n\nIt was clear soon after the bug was revealed that the number of servers affected by this bug was massive. What wasn\u2019t clear was the scope of data that was vulnerable to attack. In order to determine the risk to private keys from this vulnerability, his team launched the CloudFlare Heartbleed Challenge. They set up a site that was vulnerable to the attack, added logging and created a webpage to submit a signed proof of key ownership. In less than a day, there were several successful submissions. Nick will go over the naive (but successful) strategy used to extract keys and the more advanced technique based on Coppersmith\u2019s Method. Finally he  will discuss the *second* OpenSSL bug we discovered that allowed the private key to be extracted via Heartbleed.\n\nAfter the exploits were in the wild, his team added logging to see who was trying to exploit this bug. Nick will reveal the results of this analysis and cross-reference the results with the IPs of the test site. These numbers give new insight into how many people were attempting to maliciously exploit this flaw versus research done to probe vulnerable sites.\n\nOnce the dust settled and the team worked out the details with our CA, we revoked over 80,000 of CloudFlare\u2019s SSL certificates. This turned into an internet scaling nightmare, resulting in a constant flood of more than 40 gigabits per second of traffic to serve overgrown certificate revocation lists. Since CloudFlare provides caching for its CA, the team bore the brunt of this traffic. Their revocation lists would have DDoSed most sites (and some certificate authorities) off the internet. Nick will talk about caching CRLs, and how the revocation system was not designed for this scale of internet flaw.\n\nIn conclusion we he will summarize the many ways this coding error revealed some of the deeper flaws in the internet, and discuss ways we can move forward. Nick will share actionable advice and the security strategies used by cloud service companies on how to monitor the way companies store keys internally.\n\nAttendees will leave with actionable advice on how to better secure their own systems against the next Heartbleed and the security strategies used by cloud service companies on how to monitor the way companies store keys internally.",

I suggest to replace this confusing question by another one: what kind of information processing system is the mind, and how is the mind computed? As we will see, even our ideas of the physical universe turn out to be computational. Let us explore some fascinating scenery of the philosophy underlying Artificial Intelligence.",
        "description": "How do minds work? In my view, this is the most interesting question of all, and our best bet at answering it lies in building theories that we can actually test in the form of computer programs, that is, in building Artificial Intelligence. Let us explore some of the philosophical ideas that explicitly or implicitly form the basis of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThe idea that minds are some kind of machine, mechanical contraptions, seems to be unconvincing, even offending to many people, even if they accept that the physical universe is a machine, and minds are part of that universe. Computer science has revolutionized our concept of machines, though: no longer do we see machines as mechanical arrangements of parts that pull and push against each other, but as arbitrary, stable causal arrangements that perform regular changes on their environment. We can think about mathematical machines, like cellular automatons, about financial, social or ecological machines. Machines do not have to be human-made artifacts, they are a way of conceptualizing regular processes and dynamic systems. In the case of conceptualizing the human mind, what matters is not biology, chemistry, or structural properties of the brain, but what these implement: a class of machine that is capable to process information, in very specific ways. The mind is not necessarily a mechanical machine, but certainly an information processing machine, a computational system. \n\nComputationalism is the notion that minds can and have to be modeled as computational, and in its strong form, it maintains that the mind actually _is_ a computer, implemented by a physical mechanism. But the ideas of computation have permeated our understanding of the world even further. Our understanding of physics no longer conforms to mechanical world views (i.e. parts and particles pulling and pushing against each other), but requires us to switch to the broader notion of how the universe processes information. The foundational theories of physics are concerned with how the universe is computed.\nIn the view of universal computationalism, the question of what sort of thing minds are resolves into the question whether hypercomputation is possible, and if not, what classes of computation are involved in their functionality.\n\nComputationalism systematizes the intuitions we get naturally while we program computers, and it helps us understand some of the deepest questions of cosmology, epistemology and the nature of the mind in ways that did not exist in the past.",

Due to this we ran into some issues but ultimately succeeded. We believe that the details of the techniques that we used will prove useful for anyone attempting similar actions in the future. The topics that we will discuss in this talk will cover a wide range of high and low level issues related to network protocol and binary reversing. \n\nWe will begin with an overall survey of the general problems faced by anyone attempting this type of work. The talk will quickly delve from the high-level and simple issues into the more technical aspects of reverse engineering in the blind. We will be including the techniques we used to determine the protocol and payload responses that the client was expecting. Describing in detail how we honed in on common traits that we expected to see on the network, using open source knowledge and binary level reverse engineering of client code to determine the expected response.\n\nWe expect the attendees of this talk to walk away with knowledge that will help them in the future when working on similar projects or any activities related to protocol reverse engineering.",

Auf welche Arten von Kryptografie\nw\u00fcrde sich das wie auswirken?\n\n\n\n\n  Quantencomputer k\u00f6nnen mit Hilfe des Shor Algorithmus die g\u00e4ngigen\n  Public Key Verfahren, wie beispielsweise RSA und DSA, sehr effektiv\n  attackieren.  Aber auch die neueren Verfahren, welche Elliptische\n  Kurven verwenden, sind betroffen. F\u00fcr diese Angriffe ben\u00f6tigt man eine\n  von der Schl\u00fcssell\u00e4nge abh\u00e4ngigen Anzahl von qubits. Elliptisch Kurven\n  Kryptosysteme nutzen deutlich k\u00fcrzere Schl\u00fcssel, im Falle von Bitcoin\n  256 bit. Das klassische RSA System verwendet in der heutigen Praxis\n  mindestens 2048 bit.\n\n\n2 W\u00e4ren Bitcoins dann wertlos? Wenn ja, warum genau?\n\n\n  Ein erfolgreicher Angriff gegen die in Bitcoin verwendete\n  Signaturfunktion, w\u00fcrde wegen des geschickten Design, nicht sofort\n  alle Bitcoins wertlos machen.\n\n  Bitcoin nutzt zun\u00e4chst statt des eigentlichen \u00f6ffentlichen Schl\u00fcssels\n  eine von diesem mit Hilfe von zwei verschiedenen Hashfunktionen\n  abgeleiteten Adresse. Der Public Key wird erst bei einer \u00dcberweisung\n  selbst enth\u00fcllt. Dieses Vorgehen verk\u00fcrzt die m\u00f6glichen\n  Angriffszeiten, falls nicht noch Geld auf dem Konto gelassen wird. Aus\n  Sicherheitsgr\u00fcnden sollte f\u00fcr jede Transaktion eine neue Adresse\n  verwendet werden, was bisher nur aus Datenschutzgr\u00fcnden empfohlen\n  wurde.\n\n\n3 Was sehen Sie an der bei Bitcoin verwendeten Kryptografie kritisch?\n\n\n  Auch wenn man sicher an einigen Stellen aus Sicht der\n  Kryptographieforschung die ein oder andere Verbesserung vorschlagen\n  k\u00f6nnte, welche auch teilweise schon in alternativen Systemen\n  erfolgreich eingesetzt werden, ist jedoch gerade die Einfachheit und\n  Robustheit der eingesetzten Konstruktionen zu loben. Die Autoren\n  verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber ausgezeichnete Kryptographiekenntnisse.\n\n  Die in bitcoin verwendete Kurve Secp256k1 wurde zwar begr\u00fcndet\n  ausgew\u00e4hlt, bedarf jedoch einer intensiveren Beforschung. Die 256 bit\n  Schl\u00fcssell\u00e4nge verschafft keinen beruhigenden Sicherheitsspielraum.\n  Eine Wahl von 512 bit w\u00e4re die bessere Wahl gewesen.  Auch w\u00fcrde eine\n  Wahl von unterschiedlichen Kurven f\u00fcr jede Transaktion st\u00e4rker der\n  Bitcoin-Philosophie entsprechen.\n\n\n4 K\u00f6nnen Sie grob einsch\u00e4tzen wie lange es noch dauert bis der erste\nechte funktionierende Quantencomputer entwickelt wird? Wie hoch ist\nIhrer Einsch\u00e4tzung nach die Chance, dass das in den kommenden\nJahrzehnten passiert?\n\n\n\n\n  Es ist leider von au\u00dfen sehr schwer einzusch\u00e4tzten wie weit die\n  amerikanischen Dienste bei der Entwicklung von Quantencomputern\n  gekommen ist. Die Enth\u00fcllung von Snowden zeigten, dass die US\n  Regierung erhebliche Mittel zur Erforschung von neuartigen\n  Angriffsm\u00f6glichkeiten aufwendet In jedem Falle erscheinen Public Key\n  Schl\u00fcssell\u00e4ngen von mehr als die \u00fcblichen 256 bit empfehlenswert.\n\n\n5 Warum wird heute PostQuantum-Kryptographie so gut wie noch nicht\nverwendet? Was sind die H\u00fcrden beim Einsatz? W\u00e4re es m\u00f6glich Bitcoin auf\nPostQuantum-Kryptographie umzustellen, ohne dass dabei alle vorhanden\nCoins ihren Wert verlieren?\n\n\n\n\n\n  PostQuantum-Kryptographie ist eine recht junge Forschungsrichtung.

        "description": "The internet, perhaps the most incredible communications medium ever created, is fast becoming the nervous system of the 21st century. But right now its primary business function is to gather data about us, to categorise and sort us, to machine learn our most intimate secrets, all so that marketers can craft advertisements designed to extract as much money out of us as possible.\nAs well as being the cause of our current privacy and surveillance woes, this business model is also a surprisingly inefficient way of matching consumers with stuff they actually want and need. A vast infrastructure of ad servers, data brokers, CRMs, and real-time bidding platforms exists in order to quietly nudge consumers to buy a different brand of soap. The problem is that we are easily nudged, and being a rational consumer in the modern economy requires an impossible amount of time, information and intelligence. Realistically, it is beyond the powers of human computation.\nThe seeds of a technology-driven alternative are emerging in some corners of the economy. A range of new tools crunch through masses of pricing and product data to help consumers avoid getting ripped off, and find the products they really need. Collective buying schemes have enabled households to club together in their thousands to negotiate better, cheaper, more sustainable suppliers of home energy and other products. The growth of free software, peer production and decentralised systems demonstrate that technology for independence, co-operation and empowerment are possible outside of the traditional market model. Combining these trends suggests a possible future where ordinary people collectively pool their data, computation and buying power to drive the production and allocation of goods and services, rendering the surveillance-advertising business model redundant in the process.",

In the hacker milieu there\u2018s an originary illusion according to which \u201cfreedom of information,\u201d \u201cfreedom of the Internet,\u201d or \u201cfreedom of the individual\u201d can be set against those who are bent on controlling them. This is a serious misunderstanding. Freedom and surveillance, freedom and the panoptical belong to the same paradigm of government. \n\nHistorically, the endless expansion of control procedures is the corollary of a form of power that is realized through the freedom of individuals. Liberal government is not one that is exercised directly on the bodies of its subjects or that expects a filial obedience from them. It\u2019s a background power, which prefers to manage space and rule over interests rather than bodies. A power that oversees, monitors, and acts minimally, intervening only where the framework is threatened, against that which goes too far. Only free subjects, taken en masse, are governed. Individual freedom is not something that can be brandished against the government, for it is the very mechanism on which government depends, the one it regulates as closely as possible in order to obtain, from the amalgamation of all these freedoms, the anticipated mass effect. Ordo ab chao. \n\nGovernment is that order which one obeys \u201clike one eats when hungry and covers oneself when cold,\u201d that servitude which I coproduce at the same time that I pursue my happiness, that I exercise my \u201cfreedom of expression.\u201d \u201cMarket freedom requires an active and extremely vigilant politics,\u201d explained one of the founders of neoliberalism. For the individual, monitored freedom is the only kind there is. This is what libertarians, in their infantilism, will never understand, and it\u2019s this incomprehension that makes the libertarian idiocy attractive to some hackers. A genuinely free being is not even said to be free. It simply is, it exists, deploys its powers according to its being. We say of an animal that it is en libert\u00e9, \u201croaming free,\u201d only when it lives in an environment that\u2019s already completely controlled, fenced, civilized: in the park with human rules, where one indulges in a safari. \u201cFriend\u201d and \u201cfree\u201d in English, and \u201cFreund\u201d and \u201cfrei\u201d in German come from the same Indo-European root, which conveys the idea of a shared power that increases. Being free and having ties was one and the same thing. I am free because I have ties, because I am linked to a reality greater than me. In ancient Rome, the children of citizens were liberi : through them, it was Rome that was growing. Which goes to show how ridiculous and what a scam the individual freedom of \u201cI do what I feel like doing\u201d is.  If they truly want to fight the government, the hackers have to give up this fetish. The cause of individual freedom is what prevents them from forming strong groups capable of laying down a real strategy, beyond a series of attacks; it\u2019s also what explains their inability to form ties beyond themselves, their incapacity for becoming a historical force. A member of Telecomix alerts his colleagues in these terms: \u201cWhat is certain is that the territory you\u2019re living in is defended by persons you would do well to meet. Because they\u2019re changing the world and they won\u2019t wait for you.\u201d\n\n\tAnother obstacle for the hacker movement, as every new meeting of the Chaos Computer Club demonstrates, is in managing to draw a front line in its own ranks between those working for a better government, or even the government, and those working for its destitution. The time has come for taking sides. It\u2019s this basic question that eludes Julian Assange when he says: \u201cWe high-tech workers are a class and it\u2019s time we recognize ourselves as such.\u201d France has recently exploited the defect to the point of opening a university for molding \u201cethical hackers.\u201d Under DCRI supervision, it will train people to fight against the real hackers, those who haven\u2019t abandoned the hacker ethic.\n\n\tThese two problems merged in a case affecting us. After so many attacks that so many of us applauded, Anonymous/LulzSec hackers found themselves, like Jeremy Hammond, nearly alone facing repression upon getting arrested. On Christmas day, 2011, LulzSec defaced the site of Strafor, a \u201cprivate intelligence\u201d multinational. By way of a homepage, there was now the scrolling text of The Coming Insurrection in English, and $700,000 was transferred from the accounts of Stratfor customers to a set of charitable associations \u2013 a Christmas present. And we weren\u2019t able to do anything, either before or after their arrest. Of course, it\u2019s safer to operate alone or in a small group \u2013 which obviously won\u2019t protect you from infiltrators \u2013 when one goes after such targets, but it\u2019s catastrophic for attacks that are so political, and so clearly within the purview of global action by our party, to be reduced by the police to some private crime, punishable by decades of prison or used as a handle for pressuring this or that \u201cInternet pirate\u201d to turn into a government agent.  \n",

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "On modern Intel based computers there exists two powerful and protected code regions: the UEFI firmware and System Management Mode (SMM). UEFI is the replacement for conventional BIOS and has the responsibility of initializing the platform. SMM is a powerful mode of execution on Intel CPUs that is even more privileged than a hypervisor. Because of their powerful positions, SMM and UEFI are protected by a variety of hardware mechanisms. In this talk, Rafal Wojtczuk and Corey Kallenberg team up to disclose several prevalent vulnerabilities that result in SMM runtime breakin as well as arbitrary reflash of the UEFI firmware.\n",
        "description": "In 2009 Rafal Wojtczuk and Alexander Tereshkin described the first publicly presented BIOS reflash exploit. Then in 2013 Corey Kallenberg presented the second instance of this class of vulnerability with an exploit targeting Dell BIOS. Now, in 2014, Rafal and Corey have joined forces to complete the destruction of the jedi^H^H BIOS. \n\nThe UEFI firmware is normally the first code to execute on the CPU, putting it in a powerful position to subvert other components of the platform. Because of its security critical nature, the UEFI code resides on a flash chip that is protected against arbitrary writes via a number of chipset protection mechanisms. Besides initializing the platform and bootstrapping to an operating system, UEFI is also charged with instantiating the all powerful System Management Mode (SMM). SMM is neither readable or writeable by any other code on the platform. In fact, SMM has the ability to read and write hypervisor protected memory, but the converse is not true! These properties make SMM an ideal place to store a rootkit. Similar to the UEFI firmware, because of these security critical properties, there are hardware mechanisms that protect the integrity and confidentiality of SMM. \n\nThis talk will explore attack surface against SMM and UEFI that has not previously been discussed. We will highlight a bug in one of the critical hardware protection mechanisms that results in a compromise of the firmware. We will also directly target a part of the UEFI specification that provides SMM exploitation opportunities. The vulnerabilities disclosed and their corresponding exploits are both prevalent among UEFI systems and reliably exploitable. \n\nThe consequences of these vulnerabilities include hypervisor and TXT subversion, bricking of the victim platform, insertion of powerful rootkits, secure boot break, among other possibilities. \n",

        "abstract": "Whistleblowing is becoming a progressively popular topic and ways to technically support anonymous submissions by journalistic sources are being increasingly discussed and developed. However, there is much more to protecting sources than the technical side. There is currently little discussion about the surrounding ethics, operational security and public protections of sources. Two women that have expertise in all areas of source protection; from submission, to publication, to after-care explain and discuss what source protection really means, issues that have arisen in recent years, often causing disastrous consequences, as well as the important lessons to learn from these and successful cases.",
        "description": "Speakers: Sarah Harrison: Courage Acting Director and WikiLeaks Investigations Editor and Grace North: Jeremy Hammond campaign manager \n\nWith current technology the ability for journalists to be provided with large data sets securely is increasing. With the surveillance revelations from Snowden there is much talk about ways for the public and journalists to work online safely, and how this can be used to help protect sources. However, there are few to no discussions about a holistic attitude to source protection. In fact we can see in the past that its often not technical, but operational security issues that pose the greatest threat to source's ongoing safety, whether that is the source's or journalist's operational security, informants, or lack of after care. \n\nSource protection begins at the point of contact, and it doesn\u2019t stop at publication - in some cases, the real work actually begins at publication. From the angle of investigations editor at WikiLeaks, a publishing organisation with a clean record of source protection, Harrison is well placed to explain the nuanced areas of source protection for media, from submission through to publication.\n\nBut its not just within the publication process that source protection needs to be considered. Simply not printing a sources name is not enough. It\u2019s irresponsible for journalists to speculate about sources they know little about, or to publicly speculate that an unnamed source is on the loose. Recently media outlets have suggested there is another NSA source, leaking information to the Intercept and elsewhere. What has that incurred? The US government launched an internal investigation to hunt out any other suspected sources, and we know well what the United States does to whistleblowers.\n\nAnd for media and the public alike there is an aftercare responsibility to sources that have risked so much for our right to know - how they are supported and spoken about. Both Harrison and North are experts in how media and the public have and should protect sources. Media generally abandons sources (they did in the case of Manning and Hammond in a devastating way), this can and should change. In addition public solidarity is vital for sources, we have this past year seen a growing trend in pitting sources against one another in the public domain: Harrison and North will discuss the dangers and consequences of this. \n\nWhile the use of the term \u201cwhistleblower\u201d is increasingly used and understood, it doesn\u2019t always describe a source. Courage uses the term \u2018truthteller\u2019 to encompass all people who bring secret truths to public light. Someone like Jeremy Hammond, who did not work for Stratfor or its clients, but knew its operations were of interest to the public at large, to the citizens of a government that subscribes to Stratfor\u2019s services, is a truthteller. He is an outsider who worked, allegedly, to make important truths public, and thus a vital journalistic source, without whom we wouldn\u2019t have hundreds upon hundreds of valuable news stories on the private intelligence industry. \n\nThese lessons give us a better understanding of what has gone right and wrong with recent high-level sources, like Manning, Snowden and Hammond, but they should also be building blocks for an understanding of the principles involved and how we can employ them in the future. Courage wants to continue protecting the sources we know about, but we also work to engender a culture of support for whistleblowing, a knowledgeable and ethical media class, and a trust among sources that journalists will protect them from start to finish. We encourage whistleblowing as a key method to keeping governments and powerful corporations accountable to the public, but we must be responsible first. This talk will explain and highlight these lessons from a first hand perspective, giving an understanding of what real source protection means, and how the media and public can perform it. The speakers will take questions after. \n",

        "description": "With all the frustration around trying to get Glen Greenwald to use encryption [0,1], it is not surprising that Edward Snowden has described GPG as \"damn near unusable\" [2]. Such usability problems of end-to-end email encryption tools have been around for a long time. In 1999, a seminal study found that most participants were unable to use PGP 5.0 to encrypt an email when given 1.5 hours to do so [3]. Others have tried to solve these usability problems by automating the key exchange and encryption [4]. However, issues persist around a lack of end-user trust in the software [5], difficulties in getting encryption widely implemented, and having to deal with a general absence of understanding the email architecture [6].\n\nDespite being almost 50 years old [7], email is still not widely encrypted on an end-to-end basis. In this year's SOUPS keynote (the major conference on usable security), Christopher Soghoian described how we as a community are not doing nearly enough to get security into the hands of consumers: we are mostly stuck with the same broken interface as PGP 5.0 from back in 1999, people still face the same conceptual barriers, and we still have crappy defaults [8]. While there has been renewed interest in end-to-end email encryption after the Snowden revelations [9], many projects do not take usability into account.\n\nThis talk goes into some of the dos and don'ts gleaned from the usable security research field. Building on a discussion of the history, methodology, and findings of the research, the talk will cover topics including the constraints of humans, the need for clear mental models, and the usefulness of user testing. Some examples of successes and failures will be used to illustrate a range of usable security principles. Remaining pain points such as metadata protection, key management, and end-user understanding will be covered, including proposals for fixing these such as anonymous routing, more appropriate metaphors, and trust on first use. Various open questions will also be discussed, including:\n\n- Should we patch the existing email architecture or should we move towards new protocols?\n- How can the crypto community build subversion-resistant collaboration platforms?\n- Is there a way to standardise our cryptoplumbing to a restricted set of secure algorithms?\n- Can we provide developers with usable coding technologies to prevent nightmares like OpenSSL?\n- How should we involve end-users into the development cycle of open source software?\n- Can we empower end-users to take security back into their own hands?",

We describe a heuristic algorithm which can detect vulnerabilities of this kind. We explain the inner workings of the algorithm and demonstrate a proof-of-concept attack on sevreral examples of vulnerable data, including files encrypted by the DirCrypt malware and encrypted traffic generated by malware such as variants of Zeus and Ramnit.",
        "description": "When operating a stream cipher, reusing a keystream introduces a critical weakness to the resulting ciphertext: the encryption becomes vulnerable to easy (and sometimes /very/ easy) cryptographic attacks. This is due to the encryption's linear nature - for instance, XORing a plaintext with the corresponding ciphertext yields keystream bytes. While key reuse is a widely known issue, it's an issue that keeps arising in practice. The soviets did it during WWII, Microsoft did it in the implementation of Word 2003 document encryption, and malware authors did it when designing variants of Zeus, DirCrypt and Ramnit.\n\nTo exploit a vulnerability, you must first realize it's there. Unfortunately, many instances of homebrew crypto operate on the \"security by obscurity\" principle, and don't reveal their implementation details. As a result, detecting key reuse often requires trial and error, an accidental epiphany or a night spent reverse engineering - and in all these cases, luck and human effort. In this presentation we show an approach to automating this task - based on the linear properties of stream ciphers, redundancy in the text and Bayesian reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithm's operation in several real-world use cases.\n\nMath Ph.D. not required.",

People track a wide variety of things: doors, water consumption, visiting times, paper usage and not to forget the habits of their pets. The range of implementations starts of with dedicated Twitter streams, exploratory websites and ends of with APIs, consumable services and extensive statistics which allow analysis over time. You will get to know the detailed installation architecture which allows building your own toilet tracking.\nFurthermore, the talk outlines the serious aspects of the Internet of toilets and its importance for the society. Hygiene facts and economic considerations are discussed.\nOne of the motivations for this talk besides a general interest in the topic itself is the vision to realize such an installation for the congress in the near future (talking about 31c3).\n",

These are important debates, as net neutrality became one of the central questions about our freedom on the internet. With different faces around the globe we see a trend towards more violations of the neutrality principle which the internet was founded upon. The efforts of telecommunication companies to find new ways to monetize their networks and us users within them are countered in some countries with legislation preventing this new business models. \n\nIn 2010, after two years of preparation and a fierce battle, the Dutch\nparliament accepted a change to the Telecommunications Act which made net neutrality a principle that was protected by law. In this talk we will take stock after two years of legal protection of net neutrality in The Netherlands. Did it work and do the Dutch now have undiscriminated access to all services on the internet? Has the doomsday scenario of the providers, that subscriptions would become outrageously expensive, become reality? In which cases was the Dutch law enforced? \n\nAre there any loopholes in the Dutch implementation? If others are to\nfight for net neutrality, what are the pitfalls to avoid? And, on a more\nmeta-level, is it enough? Will net neutrality protect your freedom to\naccess websites and services, or do we need a broader type neutrality?",

These packages include smart cards, tags as well as standard packages for microcontrollers and special enclosures.\n\nCreative methods for amateurs and inexpensive ways for \"domestic use\" are depicted, including the manufacture of specialized devices and the production of dedicated preparation chemicals. For comparison, professional methods are presented in parallel, giving insight into today's industrial processes of chip preparation for reverse engineering.\n\nThe authors look back to over 25 years of private security research and nearly 20 years of professional engagement.

        "description": "'Echtes Denken ist eine Sache, die das Gehirn selbst\u00e4ndig per Autopilot erledigt.' \n\nDer Vortrag bringt Texte aus dem Buch 'Serenit\u00e4t \u2013 Anleitung zum Gl\u00fccklichsein' der Edition 'Operation Mindcrash' zum Klingen. Elektra tr\u00e4gt die Texte vor, w\u00e4hrend Andi B. auf dem Keyboard dazu improvisiert. Durch die Kombination von Text und Musik kann man entspannt zuh\u00f6ren und sich dabei in eine heitere, gelassene Stimmung versetzen lassen.\n\nSerenit\u00e4t \u2013 ein deutsches Wort, dass vermutlich aus der franz\u00f6sischen Sprache \u00fcbernommen wurde, ist heute vergessen. Es passt auch gar nicht so recht zur deutschen Mentalit\u00e4t. \u00dcberliefert ist, dass im 18. Jahrhundert im deutschen Sprachraum Personen h\u00f6chsten Respekts als 'Ihre Serenit\u00e4t' angesprochen wurden, im Sinne von 'Ihre Erhabenheit' oder 'Durchlaucht'. Im Franz\u00f6sischen und Englischen ist der Begriff dagegen gel\u00e4ufiger und bedeutet Heiterkeit, Gelassenheit, Erhabenheit, Klarheit, innere Ruhe, Frieden mit sich selbst.\n\nHinter dem Buch steckt eine radikale materialistische Philosophie \u00fcber das Gehirn und das Denken. Es geht um - oder besser gegen \u2013 die innere Narration der eigenen Heldengeschichte, durch die viele Menschen heute Ordnung in ihr inneres Erleben bringen wollen, indem sie sich selbst in ihrem Kopf eine Fabel, das M\u00e4rchen ihres Lebens erz\u00e4hlen.\n\nDer Vortrag geht an die Wurzel des Strukturmodells der menschlichen Psyche. Assoziationen mit dem Science-Fiction-Klassiker 'Snowcrash' von Neal Stephenson sind nicht ganz zuf\u00e4llig, aber nicht beabsichtigt. Wer Angst davor hat, dass sich in seinem Leben etwas \u00e4ndert, sollte diesem Programm besser nicht beiwohnen.\n\n Zu Wort kommen auch Franz Kafka, Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, Epikur, Julien Offray de La Mettrie, Jiddu Krishnamurti und Max Stirner. Vor allem letzterer hat es Elektra angetan. \u00dcber Stirner haben einige Philosophen gesagt, dass der Untergang des Menschengeschlechtes bevor st\u00fcnde, wenn sich seine Gedanken gegen die Entfremdung der Menschen verbreiten w\u00fcrden.\n\nUm Kopfschmerzen oder Schlimmeres zu vermeiden, sollte man nicht \u00fcber den Inhalt des Vortrags nachdenken. Echtes Denken ist eine Sache, die das Gehirn selbst\u00e4ndig per Autopilot erledigt. Machen Sie sich daher keine Sorgen! Nur echtes Denken hilft in Zeiten der Krise!\n",

In this talk I will introduce the concept of dependent types and the Curry-Howard isomorphism and how these can be applied to prove properties about software and eradicate whole classes of bugs and security issues.",
        "description": "Building robust software is a hard task these days. As software gets more complex it gets increasingly hard to reason about it, this leads to a larger attack surface for bugs and security flaws.\nSome of these bugs can be completely eliminated with the introduction of type systems that keep our values at runtime in check. Type systems are in fact the most widespread mechanism to verify correctness properties of programs, with dependent types we take this to the next level.\n\nWhile most dependently typed systems (e.g. Coq and Agda) aim to be proof assistants rather than programming languages. Idris tries to answer the question how a general purpose programming language with dependent types could look like, it also enables us to produce self contained binaries as well as JavaScript applications today.\n\nIn this talk I will introduce techniques for programming with dependent types as well as interaction with the programming language itself. Examples will present resource tracking in the type system e.g. tracking file handles and yielding compilation errors on resource leaks, modeling specifications of protocols as types and enforcing them.\n\nI argue that functional programming and dependently typed programming languages provide various exciting opportunities to the programmer, including a powerful mental model, compositionality and machine assisted programming through interactive editing capabilities. The presentation software for this talk will be a web application written in Idris which compiles to JavaScript using a compiler backend written by the lecturer.",

        "description": "TR-069 is the de-facto standard remote management protocol that ISPs surreptitiously use to control consumer-premises equipment (these would be your home routers, set-top boxes, VoIP phones etc.), rumored to be a well-thought conspiracy devised by Internet Service Provider secret societies since the 17th century.\n\nSince its establishment in 2004, there has been a growing trend of endorsement and deployment of the CWMP/TR-069 protocol in global carriers and service providers.\nDespite the rising popularity of this black magic, it is often overlooked in penetration tests and security assessments of Internet gateway device attack surfaces, and wrongly so. Would they reconsider if they knew TR-069 the second most popular service openly listening on the Internet (after HTTP)?\n \nThis talk will begin by describing our previous efforts presented this summer (DEF CON 22 & more), where our group revealed critically vulnerable TR-069 server deployments and discussed the incomprehensible asymmetry between the trust instated in this protocol and the measures taken to protect it (or lack thereof).\nSubsequently, we decided to go after clients \u2013 exposing a critical attack surface by design, listening on 0.0.0.0 with a publicly available IP address. While centralized servers are rather easily patched to close security holes, clients may take more effort\u2026\n \nWe will conclude with the shocking unveiling of one of the year's security stories, walking the audience through the discovery and exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in an extremely popular client implementation. Our weapon of choice this round would be embedded device reverse engineering (some soldering required), leading us all the way to remote code execution on millions of devices.",

        "abstract": "This talk asks how we might plan for the continuation of a privacy sustaining internet in light of growing trends in enforced identity checking and demonisation of everyday anonymity. It presents a 'free phonebox' project, which was tested at the FutureEverything art and technology festival in 2014, as an example of a social-technical system that promotes identity ambiguity in communication through the sharing of 'free' mobile phone minutes between strangers.",
        "description": "The project presented in this talk uses a computer running debian to connect a USB handset to one of a number of 'donor' mobile phones by acting as a bluetooth handsfree headset to each of the mobiles. The project is based on No Hands a GPLv2 implementation of the Bluetooth HFP 1.5 Hands Free Protocol. A free phonebox that randomly assigns calls made to one of the participating mobiles nearby acts a little like a low-tech remailer (mix network node). Lending strangers your phone creates 'data chaff' that helps to muddy the call record metadata logs that otherwise tie your device to you as a form of identification and tracking. It provides (some) deniability for any calls made while nearby the phonebox. Borrowing a stranger's phone lets you call someone without revealing yourself through caller-id. The close range of bluetooth, imposes a geographic limit on users.\n\nThis talk considers why a project like a free phonebox may be useful in countering growing moves to criminalise anonymous communication. People generally see the 'free time' in their mobile cell phone call plans as something that belongs to them. Lending someone in need your phone is also seen as charitable and positive. Therefore, a system that shares phone minutes between strangers provides an easier forum for debate around preservation of anonymity in communication than a similar project lending wifi connectivity. Open wifi has been gradually characterised as a tool for malicious hackers, unethical pirates and tech-savvy criminals despite the significant advantages universal connectivity could offer. Historical examples of anonymising connectivity including phoneboxes and postal systems are discussed.\n\nThe public phonebox in particular has long been associated with elements of privacy, secrecy and anonymity. The physical box affords a semi-private space in a public setting. Sound is difficult to overhear, but the caller is still in view of those nearby. Phoneboxes have historically used an anonymous payment system of coins, and require no identity authentication for access. In many countries policies of regulating call costs and mandating maintained phonebox coverage have established phoneboxes as anonymous connectivity commons. Many accounts of phoneboxes in popular culture portray them as valued resources of personal independence. Phoneboxes often provide the backdrop for narratives of family contact, emergency assistance or first kisses. The cheap and near universal nature of the phonebox makes them a recognisable anchor of reliability in new situations and locations. I would argue it is no coincidence that Superman turns to the phonebox for a moment of privacy when changing from one pseudonym to another.\n\nBen Dalton is an artist and academic researcher trained in physics, electronics and communication design, who has worked on projects on distributed sensor networks and ubiquitous computing at the MIT Media Lab, USA, big screens and pocket screens in public space at Leeds Beckett University, UK, the aesthetic, ethical and spatial dimensions of the politics of data at the National Academy of Art & Design in Bergen (KHiB), Norway, and digital pseudonymity at the Royal College of Art, UK.

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "In this presentation we demonstrate Thunderstrike, a vulnerability that allows the installation of persistent firmware modifications into the EFI boot ROM of Apple's popular MacBooks.  The bootkit can be easily installed by an evil-maid via the externally accessible Thunderbolt ports and can survive reinstallation of OSX as well as hard drive replacements.  Once installed, it can prevent software attempts to remove it and could spread virally across air-gaps by infecting additional Thunderbolt devices.",
        "description": "It is possible to use a Thunderbolt Option ROM to circumvent the cryptographic signature checks in Apple's EFI firmware update routines. This allows an attacker with physical access to the machine to write untrusted code to the SPI flash ROM on the motherboard and creates a new class of firmware bootkits for the MacBook systems.\n\nThere are neither hardware nor software cryptographic checks at boot time of firmware validity, so once the malicious code has been flashed to the ROM,  it controls the system from the very first instruction.   It could use SMM and other techniques to hide from attempts to detect it.\n\nOur proof of concept bootkit also replaces Apple's public RSA key in the ROM and prevents software attempts to replace it that are not signed by the attacker's private key.  Since the boot ROM is independent of the operating system, reinstallation of OS X will not remove it.  Nor does it depend on anything stored on the disk, so replacing the harddrive has no effect.  A hardware in-system-programming device is the only way to restore the stock firmware.\n\nAdditionally, Thunderbolt devices' Option ROMs are writable from code that runs during the early boot and the bootkit could write copies of itself to new Thunderbolt devices.  The devices remain functional, which would allow a stealthy bootkit to spread across air-gap security perimeters through shared Thunderbolt devices.\n\nWhile the two year old Option ROM vulnerability that this attack uses can be closed with a few byte patch to the firmware, the larger issue of Apple's EFI firmware security and secure booting with no trusted hardware is more difficult to fix.",

We will be focusing on a few features: cracking default passwords on network systems with minimal effort, testing for embedded backdoors and offline attacks by data mining and modeling about 33 million user account to gain insight in how users choose their passwords and how can we use that knowledge to speed up password cracking for 20% more gain for non pseudorandom passwords.",
        "description": "This talk will show a new method for password cracking called UNHash. UNHash as a tool uses rulefiles that are something in between of a DSL (Domain specific language) and a python script to describe the password cracking process. That way, we have the possibility to describe complex password cracking rules that contain dictionaries, rules, bruteforcing, joining, combining and other patterns in a language that is easily human readable and extensible. To stop reinventing the wheel, UNHash generates candidate passwords for john the ripper, hashcat or a lot of other tools that can read stdin.\n\nThe usage of \"slow\" hashes like bcrypt and scrypt will require us to try a smaller quantity of possible passwords, but with more detailed targeting. The concept behind UNHash is to enable such attacks against modern slow hashes or to enable better targeting and be faster and easier then traditional methods. \n\nTo make use of the new \"language\", we need set of rules. To generate rulesets, we will show a new machine learning algorithm that can analyze plaintext passwords and generate rules for UNHash. The machine learning algorithm shows a classifier network heuristic that we call the sieve algorithm that can classify passwords and show how users generate their passwords. Training the classifier on about 30+ million unique passwords, can yield interesting rules that describe how users pick their passwords.\n\nSince we are already classified passwords, why not use the effort to collect all password elements like words (and see which languages do they belong), strings, numbers and mutations so we can use that as a cornerstone for a new set of dictionaries. Since we already said said that we want to identify words and their languages, we needed to create a linguistic dictionary for word the use in the classifier algorithm. We will show how to create custom dictionaries for various languages or from a specific domain by parsing wikipedia database backups or by abusing really popular web services. \n\nA small portion of the talk will show why it is useful to scrape password dumps or obtain them via low interaction honeypots in order to collect known backdoor passwords. \n\nWe will skip the science and get to the practical part - How can you use UNHash for better password cracking and how to implement more classifiers so we can have a better models of how users create their passwords.\n",

Discussing last year's big exploits and congratulating each other on our ingenuity in finding them is not enough. We have to wipe the smug grins from our faces and take a long hard look into the mirror. Because there are several questions that are often unasked because we may not have the answer to them. Not solving these puzzles also means that we cannot prevent the infocoalypse of big data, the internet of things, the military-industrial-surveillance complex as well as organised crime mucking up our lives. So let us talk about our failures to:\n\n- explain general purpose computing to laypersons;\n- preventing security weaknesses from happening;\n- articulate security risks to everyday people and politicians alike;\n- educate fellow tech people about them,\n\nAnd why they are failures and why there is an urgent need to fix them.",

        "abstract": "After years of debate, EU copyright law is finally being revisited. The Commission will present a proposal for reform within 4 months of 31c3. And it's high time: There has never been a bigger discrepancy between the technical feasibility to share information and knowledge across all physical borders and the legal restrictions to actually do so. This talk outlines the unique opportunity and the challenge to bring copyright into the 21st century that lies in front of us. Hackers ensured that people were heard during last winter's public consultation. Can they now also ensure a progressive outcome of the reform process?",
        "description": "When copyright was last reformed on an EU level, YouTube and Facebook didn't exist, smartphones were unheard of. Last winter, the European Commission finally started a public consultation aimed at identifying all the ways in which the current copyright regime has been outdated by technological developments. Through projects such as Copywrongs.eu, which was developed at a workshop at 30c3, activists took it upon themselves to open the consultation to a wider audience and ensure that end users were heard. The tools they developed for that purpose, published under free licences, were even picked up by collecting societies to mobilise their members for replying to the consultation. The resulting over 9000 responses, half of which came from end users, reveal a deep divide: Individuals, cultural institutions such as libraries and scientists are calling for Europe-wide reform, whereas rightsholders are trying to defend the status quo. But the answers also point at some surprising similarities in the views of some respondents that can lead to new alliances and a copyright reform that truly finds a balance between competing societal goals.\n\nThe new EU commission was tasked by their president to present a proposal for copyright reform within 4 months of 31c3. After years of debate, 2001's copyright directive is finally being revisited. Promisingly, the mandate for copyright legislation in the new Commission has been moved from a directorate concerned mostly with economic issues to the one for \u201cDigital Society & Culture\u201d. The last Commissioner responsible for this field, Neelie Kroes, ended her mandate with a passionate call for copyright reform, describing the current legal framework in the EU as \"fragmented, inflexible, and often irrelevant\".\n\nBut what can we expect from the responsible Commissioner Guenter Oettinger, who's clearly not a digital native, and who has to answer to Commission Vice-President Andrus Ansip, formerly a fervent supporter of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ACTA? I'll explain what the new structure of the Commission means for copyright reform, who the players are, the expected timeline, what we may hope to achieve and how you can help ensure an ambitious, progressive and user-friendly outcome. This talk is also a call for hackers to involve themselves in traditional arenas of policy-making and to become more political in their demands and activities.",

These protections include several ROP (Return-Oriented-Programming) checks, shellcode detection mechansims, heap-spray mitigations and many more.\nThe talk covers techniques to bypass EMET 5.1 (the current version) and shows the audience how hard/easy it is for an attacker to accomplish this.",
        "description": "The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) is an application developed by Microsoft which adds an additional layer of security to applications to prevent attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in them.\n\nIt can be used to globally enable system mitigation techniques such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Data Execution Prevention (DEP) or Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP). In addition special per-process protections can be added such as various Return-Oriented-Programming (ROP) protections (LoadLibrary, MemProt, Caller, SimExecFlow, StackPivot), Export Address Table Access Filtering (EAF and EAF+) to prevent execution of shellcode, pre-allocations to defeat heap spraying and kernel exploitation, additional randomization (bottom-up randomization and mandatory ASLR) and advanced mitigations (deep hooks, anti detours and banned functions) to prevent different types of attacks.\n\nIf an application supports DEP together with full ASLR the difficulty to write a reliable exploit increases dramatically. The typical approach to defeat DEP is to use ROP to disable it. ROP builds on the idea to return (or jump) to small so-called gadgets (which are equal to already existing code from the code-section which end with a return or jump instruction) to chain these gadgets together to build new logic (like logic to disable DEP). If ASLR is supported by all modules of the application this approach can't be applied because the address of such gadgets is randomized by ASLR and thus unknown by the attacker. In such a case the vulnerability must be turned into an information disclosure vulnerability to first disclose an address to defeat ASLR. Techniques to accomplish this (e.g. partial overwrites, overwriting the length field of strings, ...) have already been discussed in the past and thus will not be focus of this talk.\n\nInstead further techniques will be discussed which can be used to bypass the additional per-process protections of EMET. To apply these techniques a vulnerability which allows code execution as well as leaking information (to bypass ASLR) is required. These requirements are satisfied per default because otherwise writing an exploit for a not-EMET protected application would be impossible.\n\nThe aim of this talk is to demonstrate new and more reliable exploitation techniques as well as discussing in which situations already existing techniques can be applied in a reliable way.\n\nAn important approach of exploit developers is to write bypasses in a way that they can easily be ported to other exploits. For example, if a technique requires jumping to already existing code a dumb approach would be to build it application specific. Instead the technique can be built on top of the EMET library which gets injected into all protected applications and thus is a good target to minimize work load because the code for the bypass must only be written one time. To apply such techniques various methods to identify the presence, retrieving the imagebase as well as the version of EMET will be shown.\n\nEMET also supports none memory corruption related protection techniques (like Attack Surface Reduction ASR and certificate pinning), however these will not be discussed during the talk because the focus of the talk is on memory corruption exploitation (e.g. buffer overflows, use-after-free bugs, type confusion attacks and so on).\n\nAll techniques are implemented and demonstrated in a real-world Firefox exploit. Even if the vulnerability is older (we at SEC Consult don't want to publish reliable working exploit code for applications which are still in-use these days) it is a very interesting vulnerability to study and together with a highly configurable exploit it's easy to see the different techniques in action. The exploit works reliable against any Windows operating system (Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Server 2003, Server 2008, Server 2012, ...), on 32-bit as well as on 64-bit architectures and is able to bypass EMET in all versions (EMET 4.1, 5.0 and 5.1) with all protections enabled.  \n\nMicrosoft as well as other vendors typically suggest as a workaround for new memory corruption vulnerabilities to install EMET to protect the application. The aim of the presentation is to show the audience that attackers can still exploit such protected applications by using one of the many existing techniques.\n\nWe at SEC Consult do not believe in putting additional security layers like EMET, DEP, ASLR, application firewalls and so on on top of applications. Rather we demand from software developers and especially from the software industry itself to focus on secure software development instead of forcing their customers to create a chain of security layers to protect their software product.\n\nProtections such as EMET, DEP and ASLR are useful to add an additional hurdle for attackers but are not unbreakable.",

Occasionally, they collide \u2026 because the Maker planet moves too fast.\nBut, back on the Earth. Encounters with patent law can be of many reasons, e.g. filing a patent application or being blocked in making by a patent (or much worse, being accused of a patent infringement). The latter motivated the question of the permissible uses of patented inventions. The talk explains which activities on patents are lawful and keep Makers safe in their making.\n",
        "description": "The Maker Movement does not need to be presented. Even the White House has expressed its gratitude and admiration for individual inventors \u2013 single heroes; and the World Bank has recognised their potential. \n\nBut the daily life of Makers is not (always) that sweet and victorious. As they get more technologically advanced, they face new challenges: financial, resource-related or legal.\n\nThe project focuses on the legal aspects, specifically on patent law. There are two ways Makers meet with patents: 1) they want to obtain a patent for their solution, 2) they get confronted with a patent infringement claim. The latter led to the question of the efficacy of patent flexibilities (\u201cpatent windows\u201d) that reduce the patent exclusivity over the use of an invention. They provide both the freedom to operate and enable defence in patent infringement lawsuits. \n\nThe project also contributes to the ongoing discussion on the reform of patent law, and suggests the re-consideration of certain legal tools in the light of the Maker phenomenon. \n\nBeyond any doubt, Makers deserve special attention in the legal field for a number of reasons:\n1)\ttheir technological contributions,\n2)\tpopularisation of democratic ideas: participation, trust and responsibility,\n3)\tfor making a part of this world better.\n(The patent system shared once the same principles \u2026 before it has changed into a money-making machine.)\n\nThe reference point for the research is collective making: when an idea leaves the safe private harbour (adverbial basements and garages) and enters open waters of knowledge dissemination and commercialisation, where a patent infringement may easily occur. Against this background I analyse the scope of patent windows (statutory provisions and doctrines) stipulated in four legal systems: Germany, the UK, the USA, and Japan. I present the main construction lines and apply them to the Maker environment. There are measures, e.g. private and non-commercial use or experimental use, that work in \u201cmaking\u201d but under certain reservations. \n\nThe talk serves advising and increasing the awareness of the scope of the permissible uses on patented solutions.\n",

With the advancement of photography, they were even employed as aerial surveillance drones, equipped with small automatic cameras. \nAlthough the US and British armies disbanded their pigeon sections in the 1950s, carrier pigeons are being used for communication purposes until today.\nTaking the idea of connecting flying animals with communication technology one step further, as of 2014, experiments are being conducted in wiring and remote-controlling moths, effectively turning them into biobots to be used for search and rescue missions \u2013 and possibly for military and surveillance purposes?",

Partially from language barrier, and partially due to restrictive import, export, and communication policies, there are large gaps and large amounts of misinformation around most aspects of the country.\n\nI've spent the last two falls teaching Computer Science, specifically Operating Systems and Databases, to undergraduates at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. In the course of life in Pyongyang, I've been able to observe the growing prevalence of mobile technology, and get a firsthand look at the state of consumer technology in the country.\n\nIn this talk I'll provide a demonstration of redstar 3.0, the current generation of the desktop operating system, and offer the caveat that it is seldom used in practice. I will also bring a samjiyong android tablet, to demonstrate the state of mobile technology. I'll focus the talk on discussing what international technology is and isn't applicable to the country, and the opportunities going forwards.",

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "Full-body scanners, also known as \"naked scanners\", are used in airports and other government facilities to detect metallic and nonmetallic objects hidden beneath people's clothes. In many countries, they play a critical part in airline security, but they have also been criticized for being unsafe, ineffective, and an invasion of privacy. To shed scientific lights on these questions, we conducted the first rigorous, independent security evaluation of such a system. We bought a government-surplus Rapiscan Secure 1000 full-body scanner on eBay and extensively tested it in our lab. We found that it's possible to conceal knives, guns, and explosives from detection by exploiting properties of the device's backscatter X-ray technology. We also investigated computer security threats: malicious software and hardware that can compromise the effectiveness, safety, and privacy of the machine. In this talk, we'll explain how full-body scanners work, describe the results of our experiments, and draw lessons to inform transportation security, embedded systems security, and the public debate over secretive and privacy invasive government technologies.",
        "description": "In response to evolving terrorist threats, including non-metallic explosive devices and weapons, the U.S. TSA has adopted full-body scanners as the primary passenger screening method at nearly 160 airports nationwide at a cost exceeding $1 billion.  Although full-body scanners play a critical role in transportation security, they have generated considerable controversy, including claims that the devices are unsafe, violate privacy and civil liberties, and are\nineffective.  Furthermore, these scanners are complex embedded systems that raise important computer security questions.\n\nDespite such concerns, neither the manufacturers nor the government have disclosed enough technical details to allow for rigorous independent evaluation, on the grounds that such information could benefit attackers, or is a trade secret. To help advance the public debate, we purchased a government-surplus Rapiscan Secure 1000 full-body scanner and performed a detailed security evaluation of its hardware and software.\n\nWe tested the Secure 1000's effectiveness by experimenting with different methods of concealing contraband. While the device performs well against naive attackers, fundamental limitations of its backscatter X-ray technology allow more clever attackers to defeat it.  We show that an adaptive adversary can confidently smuggle contraband past the scanner by carefully arranging it on his body, obscuring it with other materials, or properly shaping it.  Using these techniques, we are able to hide firearms, knives, plastic explosive simulants, and detonators in our tests.  These attacks suggest a failure on the part of the Secure 1000's designers and the TSA to think adversarially.\n\nWe also evaluated the security of the Secure 1000 as a cyberphysical system. We show how malware infecting the operator's console could selectively render contraband invisible to screeners. We also attempt (with limited success) to use software-based attacks to bypass the scanner's safety interlocks and deliver an elevated X-ray radiation dose. Lastly, we show how an external device carried by an attacker can capture naked images of the subject being scanned.\n\nOur results suggest that the Secure 1000 is not able to guarantee effectiveness or privacy against attackers who are knowledgeable about its inner workings, and that such knowledge is easy to obtain for an attacker with modest resources. We believe this study reinforces the message that security systems must be subjected to testing that is rigorous, adversarial, and public before they can be deemed safe for critical applications.\n\nWarning: Nudity. We plan to show unmodified scanner images in order to demonstrate the privacy implications of full-body scanning.\n",

After an introduction providing some background information on these topics, we present CAESAR, a new cryptographic competition which aims to find solutions to the problems mentioned above. In the second part of the talk, we introduce NORX, a new and next-generation AE scheme and our candidate for CAESAR.",

CAESAR aims to identify a portfolio of authenticated encryption (AE) schemes with support for associated data (AD). Compared to ciphers like AES-CBC or Salsa20, protects not only confidentiality, but also authenticity and integrity of the processed data.  Before we give an introduction to CAESAR, we present the motivations behind the competition, like the importance to protect in-transit data, a lack of reliable AE(AD) standards or the repeated crypto failures in recent history that led, for example, to the cracking of WEP (aircrackng), and to attacks on (D)TLS, like BEAST and Lucky13.</p>\n\n<p>In the second part, we talk about <strong>NORX</strong>, our CAESAR candidate: NORX is a user-oriented cipher, engineered to take advantage of modern CPUs and to scale to different levels of parallelism. NORX relies on trusted building blocks, adapted to meet our design goals:\n<ul>\n    <li>the sponge construction (as used in Keccak/SHA-3) is tuned to provide parallel processing</li>\n    <li>the core of NORX is inspired by the ciphers Salsa20 and ChaCha (by DJB), and the hash function BLAKE(2) (by Aumasson et al.)</li>\n</ul>\nWe explain how we selected NORX's operations and parameters to achieve maximized security and efficiency in both soft- and hardware. We also report on detailed benchmark results showing that NORX is among the fastest CAESAR candidates on various platforms, from ARM and x86 to ASICs. For example, on Intel's Haswell microarchitecture, NORX achieves 2.51 cycles per byte (more than 1 gigabyte per second), exploiting local parallelism provided by AVX2 instructions.</p>\n</div>",

        "subtitle": "The Role of Stylometry in Privacy",
        "abstract": "Stylometry is the study of linguistic style found in text. Stylometry existed long before computers but now the field is dominated by artificial intelligence techniques.\n\nWriting style is a marker of identity that can be found in a document through linguistic information to perform authorship recognition. Authorship recognition is a threat to anonymity but knowing ways to identify authors provides methods for anonymizing authors as well. Even basic stylometry systems reach high accuracy in classifying authors correctly.  Stylometry can also be used in source code to identify the author of a program. In this talk, we investigate methods to de-anonymize source code authors of C++ and authors across different domains. Source code authorship attribution could provide proof of authorship in court, automate the process of finding a cyber criminal from the source code left in an infected system, or aid in resolving copyright, copyleft and plagiarism issues in the programming fields. Programmers can obfuscate their variable or function names, but not the structures they subconsciously prefer to use or their favorite increment operators. Following this intuition, we create a new feature set that reflects coding style from properties derived from abstract syntax trees. We reach 99% accuracy in attributing 36 authors each with ten files. We experiment with many different sized datasets leading to high true positive rates.  Such a unique representation of coding style has not been used as a machine learning feature to attribute authors and therefore this is a valuable contribution to the field. \n\nWe also examine the need for cross-domain stylometry, where the documents of known authorship and the documents in question are written in different contexts. Specifically, we look at blogs, Twitter feeds, and Reddit comments. While traditional methods in stylometry that work well within one domain fail to identify authors across domains, we are able to improve the accuracy of cross-domain stylometry to as high as 80%. Being able to identify authors across domains facilitates linking identities across the Internet making this a key privacy concern; users can take other measures to ensure their anonymity, but due to their unique writing style, they may not be as anonymous as they believe. ",
        "description": "Anonymity is a topic researched in detail at the Privacy, Security, and Automation Lab at Drexel University. We study how to effectively identify the author of text with unknown authors and how to anonymize text of known authorship. In our previous talks at CCC, we have presented methods to identify authors of regular text, translated text and users a.k.a cyber-criminals of online underground forums.  We introduced our authorship anonymization framework \u2018Anonymouth\u2019.  Many times, we received questions on how applying de-anonymization techniques would work on source code and different domains. In this year\u2019s talk, we will focus on identifying the authors of source code and cross-domain stylometry. \n\nCan the authors of source code be identified automatically through features of their programming style? Do they leave coding \u201cfootprints\u201d?  Holding important implications for protecting intellectual property as well as for identifying malware authors and tracking how malware spreads and evolves, this question spurred a cross-cutting research project involving NLP and machine learning.  Code stylometry requires features unique to coding and to the programming language.  Source code has different properties than common writing, such as the lineage, keywords, comments, the way functions and variables are created, and the grammar of the program. \n   \nAware that methods from text analytics can strengthen cyber analytics, this project sought to advance the potential of automated linguistic-type analysis, or stylometry, for authorship attribution of source code. A corpus of tens of thousands of users was built by scraping Google Code Jam Competition dataset.  Specifically investigated were new ways of representing coding style through NLP-inspired syntactic, lexical and layout features. Random forests with 300 hundred trees were used along with less than ten decision features per tree. The main dataset had 173 authors each with six source code files with less then 100 lines of C++ code.  A series of experiments was performed to discover the feature set that yielded the highest recognition accuracy: 91%.  57% of the features with information gain were syntactic and the rest were lexical and layout features. Tests on a validation dataset of exact same size showed 86% accuracy with the same features.  The features that had information gain in the validation experiments all had information gain in the original dataset, which shows that the method and feature set are robust and abstract syntax trees show best promise.\n\nSource code is just one domain studied in authorship attribution. We also study the problem of domain adaption in stylometry. Can we identify the author of an anonymous blog from a suspect group of Twitter accounts? The ability to do so would lead to the ability to link accounts and identities across the Internet.  We can achieve high accuracy at identifying authors of documents within the same domain, including blogs, Twitter feeds, and Reddit comments, even when classifying with up to 200 authors. Identifying the author of a group of tweets from among 200 tweeters yields an accuracy of 94% and identifying the author of a blog entry from among 200 bloggers yields an accuracy of 71%. When we try to identify to author of a collection of tweets based on a collection of blogs from 200 authors, however, accuracy drops to 7% using the same method and features. \n\nWe are able to increase the accuracy, however, by applying an augmented version of doppelganger finder, a stylometric approach for multiple account detection that can handle small stylistic changes. This provides significant improvements in each of the cross-domain cases.\n\nAdvances in authorship attribution offer both positive and negative repercussions for security. However, it is important to understand the assumptions that underlie these results. Blind application of stylometric methods could be dangerous if the domain is not understood. This work shows that stylometric methods are domain dependent. Whether used defensively or offensively, this is certain to impact user account security.  ",

J!NS MEME is the first consumer level device measuring eye movements using electrodes also called Electrooculography (EOG). The MEME glasses not a general computing platform. They can only stream sensor data to a computer (e.g. smart phone, laptop, desktop) using Bluetooth LE. Sensor data includes vertical and horizontal EOG channels and accelerometer + gyroscope data. The runtime of the device is 8 hours enabling long term recording and, more important, long term real-time streaming of eye and head movement. They are unobtrusive and look mostly like normal glasses.\nFor Google Glass I present an open sensor-logging platform (including the infrared sensor to count eye blinks) and a fast interface to do lifelogging. \n\nWe will discuss which eye movements correlate with\nbrain functions and how this fact can be used \nto estimate the cognitive task a user is performing,\nfrom fatigue detection, over reading segmentation\nto cognitive workload and the advances to track attention and concentration. Challenges discussed in the talk include how to get ground truth and how to evaluate performance in general.\n",

        "description": "Imagine the possibility of creating stories that can be felt through the audience's own body as something real. For example, what would it mean for the world if citizens from opposite sides of a war could swap bodies and feel what it is like to be part of the family of their own enemy? What if every school child could experience, in full immersion, the life of another young person half way around the world? How would this impact our ability to share our pain, address the challenges we share, resolve conflicts and build empathy, or even improve our emotional resilience as individuals?\n\nWe developed a system that allows users to enter the body of a different person and inhabit each other\u2019s experiences in a radically different way; a way of sharing that transports us to a place of preverbal, embodied empathy. The Machine to Be Another is a Creative Commons interactive system designed as a tool for embodied-immersive storytelling. We merge interaction protocols from neuroscience research in embodiment with performance, storytelling and virtual reality hardware to create in users the illusion of feeling themselves in the body of another person. Embodied simulation mechanisms, in particular of actions, emotions and corporeal sensations have been recently proposed as having deep implications in the understanding of empathy and social cognition, perception of one\u2019s body, neural plasticity but also in the formation of concepts .For example, studies conducted by EventLab in Barcelona suggest the effectiveness of inducing body ownership for reducing implicit racial bias. This \u201cbody swap illusion\u201d is so strong that a person can experience being in another\u2019s body when facing her own body and shaking hands with \u201cthemselves\u201d.\n\nFor two years we have been working with an extended community of researchers, artists, activists and members of the public to create performance-experiments related to the understanding of the other and the self. Through this processes we have explored issues such as mutual respect, immigration and physical disability bias, gender identity, conflict resolution, body extension and embodied dance performances. \n",

The original algorithm for this is inherently 2D, but parts of it can be extended to higher dimensions, producing interesting results.\n\nDue to time constraints, it is assumed that the audience is already roughly familiar with - or willing to believe in - the general method for 3D projections, including vector and matrix maths. There will also be pretty pictures.\n\nThe presentation will have live demo segments mixed in, which make use of a F/OSS 4D+ primitive and fractal renderer called \"Topologic\" (see links, below).",

Nope, because they only talk to one dedicated app. \nThere are cooking devices with touch screen, built-in recipes and sometimes even networking capabilities.

We want to use ALL available data for cooking. Even data from WWF about sustainability or data from scientific research about nutrients.\nAnd we want to show how we treat this data. We want our database open for all useful input. \nAs we do for our Hardware. If you see a weak part in our designs you can tell us and we'll change it if needed.\nI will tell you what we learned making 4 generations of digital cooking devices. And I would like to explain you why we believe that there should be open standards for cooking software. \nWhat is now done \"in the market\" is that many companies develop many, many apps and some kitchen devices and none of them is made to interact with it's neighbors. Why? \"because my data is my data!\" and \"my hardware design is mine!\" \nIsn't that a huge waste of resources? Everyone re-inventing the wheel and then adding some little special sauce to claim the whole thing as \"unique\". \nHaving all data about food available is not a need, it is a human right. Having additional data on how to prepare food in machine readable form is a nice extra. Having both together in a database is the technically best solution because of the many synergies. \nLet's form the future of digital cooking before someone else does!",

        "abstract": "So you want to author a next Stuxnet (or even cooler than that). Here is the success recipe: forget what you have known about cyber security. When an attack transitions from control of a digital system to control of a physical process, physics and time become controlling factors instead of the digital rules encoded into your microcontroller.\n\nThe holly CIA trinity is meaningless in the physical world. The uncontrollable but still running process is not really available; process dynamics does not stop simply because the controlling equipment is DoSed; electronically segregated components can still communicate over physical media (the process) and a physical phenomenon can be measured terribly wrongly (so that the wrong measurement will be  proudly delivered to the digital application in a totally secure way). Where physics plays a governing role, IT security concepts are rendered useless. \n\nPlease welcome a new arrival in the \"damn\"-frameworks series - Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process. Come to the lecture and learn what it takes to exploit a physical process: how to find vulnerabilities and how to exploit them with minimal cost and maximum impact. Get astonished about the gazillion of uncertainties you will have to face on your way to disruptive goal and realize that the TIME is ONLY what matters while designing your attack .\n\nMake sure to visit local library and refresh your knowledge on physics, chemistry, mechanics, control theory, signal processing and algorithms. The lecture will teach you how to apply this knowledge in the exciting world of cyber-physical exploitation.\n",
        "description": "Attackers and researchers have shown numerous ways to compromise and control the digital systems involved in process control (plants, grids, cars). Little information is available what to actually do with those controls. A single bit flip can engage the burner under a tank of chemicals, but the reaction will still take hours to complete regardless of the state of the controller outputs. Changing the state of the outputs does not immediately put the process into a vulnerable state.  An attacker needs to take into account the timing and state of the system and act when the process is in the vulnerable state. \n\nDesigning an attack on a cyber-physical systems leads to unconventional  hacking and interesting computer science challenges. Thus, DoS attacks on controlls in the physical domain do not deny process dynamics. In fact, if timed wisely, DoS attack allow manipulation of the process at will. Whoever thinks that cryptography will safe the world is wrong. Due to the specifics of controll principles and their implementation in the equipment, DoS attacks allow manipulation of process controls even if the communication is authenticated. \n\nOn the example of the DoS attacks on controller inputs and outputs at the level of communication links the lecture will take the audience through all the stages and details of (i) designing and (ii) implementing such attacks to cause physical damage. The experiments are conducted on the realistic model of a  chemical plant used in process engineering research.",

It is not that easy to find pages that were made in 93-97 and are still online or look the same. Things changed in 2009, when Yahoo announced that they are closing Geocities, number one free hosting service of the last century, \"myspace of the 90es\", first home for many web users and a jest for \"professional web\"\n\nIn half a year yahoo gave its users to copy their data, Archive Team managed to partly rescue the pages and release one terabyte torrent of it. In 2010 my partner Dragan Espenschied and I started to download the files. In the middle of 2011 Dragan restored the archive and we started to go through the profiles: collecting, tagging, comparing, analyzing. One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age project started.\n\nWe don't only collect and restore but bring this culture of the 90es back to the web, using contemporary infrastructure. It is http://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/ that posts a screenshot of a page every 20 minutes since February 2013. Or my channel on Vine, that allows to see those pages animated and with sound. And of course the blog http://contemporary-home-computing.org/1tb/ where we describe the findings.\n\nIn my HIGHLY ILLUSTRATED talk I'd like to introduce to the audience pearls of the early web culture, going much deeper than usual Under Construction signs and animated GIFs nostalgia. Will show what did it mean to make a web page technically, philosophically and ideologically.

What can a play from 1605 tell us about fairer distribution of natural resources today? Equally, how might a cyber thriller from 2011 help us debate contentious issues such as gene-based technologies and utopian visions of knowledge-led society? This talk considers agri-tech and food security across a wide sweep of social and political terrain, from the Arab Spring to the European horsemeat scandal, from Shakespeare to Daniel Suarez. It argues that the arts and sciences need to cooperate to deepen understanding about, and define actions on, the big challenges facing a needy world. Finally, it suggests ways in which the arts and technology can assist us in arriving at a model of society in which resources are distributed not only more efficiently, but also more equitably.",
        "description": "We are facing a crisis of food that threatens to overwhelm households, communities and even entire states. Inequality of access to sustenance has been exacerbated by soaring prices, corporate sharp practice and wide \u201cfood fraud\u201d \u2013 including 2013\u2019s UK horsemeat scandal, and Europol\u2019s expos\u00e9 of \u201cfake\u201d and \u201csubstandard\u201d food in Europe in 2013-14. Riots and political unrest that appear to have little connection with food, on closer inspection turn out to have dimensions associated with sustenance. For example, the first shop to be looted in 2011\u2019s London Uprising was not a branded trainers outlet or flat-screen TV centre, but the Clarence Convenience Store, raided for chocolate bars and bottled water. In its first moments, then, the unrest in Britain\u2019s capital took the form of a traditional \u201cfood riot\u201d. Similarly, the first wave of protest that gave rise to the Arab Spring was initiated by the self-immolation of a street vendor who made his living selling fruit and vegetables from a cart in Tunis. As a result of food-related political unrest, food security has risen on the agendas of governments and international agencies around the world.\n\nAgri-tech has come to be regarded as the panacea to food constraint. MEP Julie Girling is not alone in arguing that \u201ctechnological advancement will be the only way that we can meet the coming growth in demand\u201d. Certainly, the technization of food production and distribution \u2013 advances in gene-based technologies, synthetic biology, agri-robots, remote sensing, agri-infomatics and just-in-time (JIT) algorithms \u2013 offers a compelling vision of knowledge-led development. However, as this talk argues, technology is only one part of the story. Until the quality of public engagement is improved around agri-tech, the nature of our food, where it comes from, and the conditions in which it is produced, programmes aimed at establishing a more equitable, ethical, sustainable future society worth living will be compromised. In this regard, the arts can open a shared spae of imagination.\n\nThis talk develops findings from my forthcoming interdisciplinary book, co-authored with literary scholar Dr Jayne Archer and plant scientist Professor Howard Thomas, Food and the Literary Imagination. Our argument is that vital, deep knowledge about food, technology and society is to be found in art and literature, both historical and contemporary. In this talk, I explore what art and literature, as heuristic media, can tell us about our relation to food technology, what they can contribute to global debates about the ethics and mechanics of food production, and their role in helping us to imagine a society in which resources are distributed not only more efficiently, but also more equitably.\n\nPart 1 considers former systems consultant Daniel Suarez\u2019s 2011 novel Freedom TM (German title, Darknet), popular among hacker communities for its kinetic scenes of \u201cD-space\u201d cyber combat. At the novel\u2019s radical centre, however, is a vivid portrait of an utopian agricultural society founded on tech-led solutions to food supply. Suarez\u2019s \u201cdarknet farms\u201d of the future represent a serious intervention into the politics of C21 agri-tech and food security. In this respect, Freedom TM belongs to a long tradition of the arts exploring contemporary food politics, stretching back to include Shakespeare\u2019s play King Lear (c. 1605), key sections of which are set \u2013 modern directors often forget \u2013 in a wheatfield, and John Constable\u2019s The Hay Wain (1821), widely misunderstood as a themepark fantasy of rural life and the origins of food, regularly voted Britain\u2019s \u201cbest loved\u201d painting.\n\nPart 2 discusses three projects in which I am involved, each aimed at improving public dialogue around food and food politics at local and regional levels: (1) a creative commons project, \u201cEdible Wales\u201d (funded by CEWN/AHRC); (2) the Welsh Govt/EU-funded \u201cFood Engagement Wales\u201d; and (3) a project being developed with a major UK supermarket to examine practical ways in which literature can be used to promote public understanding of food as we search for a sustainable, resilient, more equitable future society.",

Don\u2019t we have computers to do that for us!? We do \u2013  but there\u2019s no widespread support for including licensing or author information when sharing or reusing digital works. This session will discuss how this should work in the open knowledge environment, and could it be that many problems regarding copyright and \"piracy\" in our digital society could be solved with the right technology?\n\nLet's take a step back and consider how we perceive photographs that we see, online and offline. Didn't you ever want to know who took that awesome photo that you scrolled past in a blog? Or find out more about where that image on Twitter or Facebook comes from? Finding this information for digital photographs can be a daunting task! Sometimes I don't even remember myself where a photograph I took was taken!\n\nMost people have a drawer of black and white photographs at home, a collection of the family history. A very natural reaction when you take a photo, which most people can also relate to, is to turn it over and look at the back of it, hoping that someone -- a parent or grandparent perhaps -- have written on the back of the photo when it was taken, where and who's pictured. The information scribbled on the back represent the context of a piece of art; it's what gives the photograph meaning and value. Metadata is the digital equivalent of your grandmothers handwriting -- giving meaning to pieces of art. By persistently associating the metadata of a photograph with the photograph itself -- making the metadata \"stick\" -- we can even make sure that your grandmothers handwriting stays with the photograph, even when someone photocopies just one side of it. Assuming the technology makes this easy, of course.\n\nVery recently, we've seen the emergence of technology enabling someone to copy a photograph from a web site, insert it into an editor, and have that editor automatically pick up the associated metadata and provide the correct attribution and licensing information. This has been made possible with the Creative Commons Rights Expression Language (CC-REL), other RDFa metadata, and a clever way of passing information between applications on the clipboard.\n\nIn order to relate effectively to the digital works we see online,  attribution (who made or built something) matters. It is obvious that proper attribution is the currency of the information age, and it's the start of being able to explore digital works online in their right context. This talk will focus on the philosophical background of why attribution matters, the benefits that technology can bring to the way we work with pieces of art (lolcats and Shakespeare alike), and where we're heading in the future.",

        "description": "<b>Trusting servers you can't touch</b> by Ryan Lackey:\nServers for Internet applications are usually deployed at a distance from both the end users of the service and the administrators of the system, often controlled by third parties. Even when they're hardware vs. virtualized/cloud, it's rare for admins to have direct physical control of the servers. Yet, most applications require a high degree of trust in the integrity of servers. We describe a variety of technologies and solutions to this problem, and a framework to best protect your applications and your users.\n\n<b>dename: decentralized, secure, usable PKI</b> by Andreas Erbsen:\nA major challenge for private online communication is public key distribution. Trusted authorities have failed to be secure, and the web of trust has failed to build the network effect it gravely requires to be usable. This talk proposes a new PKI system built on a cryptographic consensus protocol. A set of directory servers updates and signs a mapping from public keys to names. Anyone can run their own server, strengthening the security guarantee for all clients that know it. We have an open-source implementation that can be easily integrated with  systems that currently rely on manual key verification, including secure \nmessaging, host authentication, and software distribution.\n\n<b>New development in OTR</b> by Jurre van Bergen \nJurre van Bergen will speak about new developments in the world of `off-the-record` messaging. What is going on? Where are we going? In addition we will address frequently answered questions by developers and users.\n\n<b>Secure email communication - LEAP Encryption Access Project &\nPixelated Your Right to</b> by Varac\nThis presentation will introduce two new secure communication tools under development that help guarantee the right to digitally whisper \u2013 LEAP and Pixelated.\n\n<b>Dark Mail</b> by Ladar Levision\nSince Ladar Levison shuttered Lavabit during the summer of 2013, he has been working to solve the email privacy problems that made it technologically possible for an American court to demand unfettered access to the email messages for all of Lavabit\u2019s worldwide customers. After a year of hard work, the Dark Internet Mail Environment (DIME) is a standards based, collaborative effort to create an elegant technical solution capable of protecting the privacy of everyone\u2019s email. It is focused on making end-to-end email encryption automatic, while providing message confidentiality, author verification, and minimizing the leakage of metadata. DIME capable systems reduce the amount of trust users must place in their service provider. Automating the key exchange process while keeping the system resistant to manipulation by sophisticated threats is an ongoing challenge. This talk offers a compressed discussion of the DIME standards, highlighting key portions and will be followed by a project update, where we hope to showcase a DIME capable client and server implementation.\n\n<b>TLS \u2665 DNS \u2665 Tor</b> by equinox\nReplacing 100 CA hierarchies with the single DNS hierarchy, and how the bite reflex against the latter is coming at the cost of less secure identities.\n",

From this, we were able to collect the list of Tor onion addresses AND the number of requests for each site (e.g. loosely analogous to the number of visitors).\n\nWe then used a custom web crawler to crawl all the hidden services and pull a large set of information from each.  From this, in this talk, we present a the information we found, from the list of the top onion addresses by content type and by popularity to estimates on size and turnover.  We will also present what the largest proportion of Tor Hidden Service traffic is (it isn't pretty, and it's not drugs/silk road!).\n\nFinally, I will explain the main classes of attacks useful for deanonymising the Hidden Services and Tor users.  Sadly, it's easier than the Tor user-base at large think and thus far, there have been no patches or fixes for these attacks and there isn't likely to be because they exploit fundamental weaknesses in the way Tor works.\n",

Because it's custom and many times even cheaper.\n\nHow-To grind your own mirror, lens, test its optical properties and build the telescope around that optics. The focus will be on newtonian telescopes but other types will be outlined as well.\n\nGrinding the optical components is the trickiest part, here the techniques and methods are explained, especially how to make high precission optics with your own hands.\n\nTesting those is very critical especially in the late manufaturing process, but optical testbenches can be made for as much as 30-50\u20ac\n\nThe most time consuming part is the building of the telescope itself, here many aspects have to be considered and taken into account.",

        "subtitle": "Evaluating a complex cryptographic implementation",
        "abstract": "In the parliamentary elections of September 2013, more than 250 000 Norwegians in selected municipalities were able to vote from home. They were taking part in a national trial of Internet voting, building on an advanced cryptographic protocol.",
        "description": "The Norwegian e-vote project started in 2008, and was used for live election trials in 2011 and 2013. By using cutting-edge cryptography  and committing to a high degree of openness in all parts of the execution, the project aimed to overcome public concerns about security risks and lack of verifiability.\n\nTo promote security, the entire voting system was implemented using a complex and verifiable cryptographic protocol, with no assumed trust between different system functions. To promote openness, the entire election system source code is publicly available, as well as most project documentation. The voting system would published the SHA-256 hashes of encrypted ballots on GitHub every hour, and detailed instructions were provided to voters on how to verify that their vote had been submitted.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2013 elections, the author audited the cryptographic Java implementation of the back-end election system, making a number of surprising findings. During the actual elections, a major encryption bug was discovered in the Javascript frontend code, potentially revealing the preferences of a large number of voters.\n\nMost hackers and cryptographers are highly sceptical of Internet voting, due to legitimate security concerns. Even so, insufficient technical security, or even the perception of such, does not appear to be a main reason for why the project was discontinued.\n\nThe aim of this talk is twofold. First, we shall look at Norway's Internet voting project in its social and political context, highlighting the reasons why it came to be, and some of the key forces shaping the project throughout. Secondly, we discuss the findings, experiences and lessons learned from attempting to audit a large, public, complex and security-critical code base.",

        "description": "Quantum computing uses quantum phenomena directly such as superposition and entanglement to perform data processing. However, applying these quantum concepts to macroscopic devices such as computers is an enormous challenge for information scientists and physicists alike. What does it make so hard? Well, scientists have to find a material in which they are able to store and manipulate quantum bits (qubits). Since quantum states are very fickle and thus hard to abide the most important task is to find materials in which qubits can be stored for a sufficient long time. Surprisingly they found these properties in diamond. More specific, scientists are investigating defect centers in diamond to be used as qubits. Although quantum computing in 2014 is still in its infancy first experiments have already been carried out that give hope that these computational concepts will become reality.\nThis talk is an entertaining \u201ctour de force\u201d starting with a brief introduction to the fascinating yet strange theories of quantum physics, the concepts of using these in quantum computing and the latest results on qubits in devices made out of diamond. Moreover this presentation is given by a physicist who was working on diamond for various other applications for years - who suddenly realized that he has the material for the next IT revolution right in his lab.\nIf you want to learn about the machines that decrypt your passwords in the coming years and how you can actually grow diamonds in your microwave oven (and who wouldn\u2019t?) this talk is for you!\n",

        "description": "New methods and approaches for securing cloud environments are becoming increasingly more critical now that virtual environments are being widely adopted by the businesses sector. Despite the fact that virtualization itself is not inherently insecure, the majority of virtual systems are less secure than those physical systems they replace. This curious state arises primarily because traditional host security strategies are not well integrated into virtual environments: as an example, typical antivirus scans are a critical component of layered defense-in-depth, but they rapidly exhaust available CPU and memory when protecting a large number of virtual machines. Some antivirus vendors have taken a small step into virtualization by adapting their existing products to scan the disks of VMs from an external perspective, but this gain in efficiency does not fully realize the potential for protection and monitoring of a virtual environment. In addition, weakly implemented \u201dself-defense\u201d techniques leave themselves vulnerable to being neutralized by undetected or zero-day attacks. This \u201done opportunity\u201d for success is a critical handicap for existing protective measures.\n\nVirtualization nevertheless also offers a unique opportunity: the ability to peer into a running operating system from an outside perspective, known as introspection (VMI). It is possible to observe the memory, storage, CPUs, processes, and kernel of a running virtual machine from a safe vantage point. More interestingly, it is also possible to alter the behavior of all of these components to help protect virtual systems. The open-source LibVMI library has been designed specifically for this purpose, to look at 32-bit or 64-bit virtual machines, both on x86 and ARM. Over the last year, as part of DARPA's Cyber Fast Track program, LibVMI has been significantly extended by our team to ease the process of developing secure intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems for the cloud. Utilizing Xen's advanced memory access system and the latest virtualization extensions available on Intel processors, LibVMI now offers unique capabilities for instrumenting, inspecting and controlling the execution of hosted guest operating systems and applications. Further combined with Xen's Security Modules, cloud security applications can be now tailored to provide a multi-tiered security environment required for multi-tenant cloud deployments.\n\nIn this talk we will explore the finer details how these features can be utilized for the detection of advanced rootkits techniques, while providing a stealthy, tamper resistant environment. Our talk will explore the disaggregation of Xen's trusted computed base (TCB) with the use of the FLASK policy engine, and the changes our team implemented and contributed to Xen and the Linux kernel, to make secure cross-domain introspection part of a coherent mandatory access control system. Diving deeper into the virtualization details of the x86 architecture we will discuss advanced instrumentation techniques via the Extended Page Tables and via software breakpoint injection, and how these features are now accessible via the LibVMI API.\n\nWe will also discuss critical details of live memory introspection and highlight common pitfalls in developing secure applications without relying on untrusted and potentially compromised data-sources. We will explore how mapping in-memory Linux and Windows kernels is performed by LibVMI, and compare it to other forensics tools, such as Volatility and Rekall. Our talk will further explore how to use existing forensics tools on live virtual machine to analyze modern malwares. At last, we will briefly discuss open challenges in virtualization security and some of the new CPU features proposed by Intel.",

        "description": "In the past, whenever we decided to start a new project, we always thought about possible legal implications in advance. Usually these would be easy to ignore as these implications used to result in small fines for public disturbance, copyright infringement, and your average threatening lawyer's letter. By now, anti-terrorist laws disable us to think freely about projects and issues that touch state authority and terrorism, because thinking terror already consitutes a crime. Hence we changed our strategy and went into the underground with \"illegal art\", we have decided to publish such projects anonymously and internally we call them our \"Secret Projects\". We can never be connected to what we artistically do in the underground. But I will present the changing social habitat and legal circumstances affecting the production process for artists by showcasing some of our key UBERMORGEN projects and revealing as little as possible about our \"Secret Projects\". \n\nIn my talk I need to call to attention the many cases of self-censorship that every user on the net takes part in, the immensly negative effects of this lemming-like behavior and the reflection of this downward spiral in the revolting newspeak that has taken over the mass media and the lovely commercial social networks. Because what we are experiencing right now by means of a soft transformation, is a totalitarian take-over while the majority of the artists are focused on career, money and reputation instead of resistance, subversion and reflection.

After that it introduces the necessary tools, gives tips on how to detect the processor architecture, and explains some more advanced analysis techniques, including how to figure out the offsets where the firmware is loaded to, and how to start the investigation.",
        "description": "The talk focuses on the different steps to be taken to acquire and analyze the firmware of an embedded device, especially without knowing anything about the processor architecture in use. Frequently datasheets are not available or do not name any details about the used processor or System on Chip (SoC).\n\nFirst the prerequisites, like knowledge about the device under investigation, the ability to read assembly language, and the tools of the trade for acquisition and analysis, are shown.\n\nThe question \"How do I get the firmware out of device X?\" makes the next big chapter: From easy to hard we pass through the different kinds of storage systems and locations a firmware can be stored to, the different ways the firmware gets transferred onto the device, and which tools we can use to retrieve the firmware from where it resides.\n\nThe next step is to analyze the gathered data. Is it compressed in any way? For which of the various different processor architectures out there was it compiled for? Once we successfully figured out the CPU type and we've found a matching disassembler, where do we start to analyze the code? Often we have to find out the offset where the firmware is loaded to, to get an easy-to-analyze disassembler output. A technique to identify these offsets will be shown.\n\nThe last chapter covers the modifications we can apply to the firmware, and what types of checksum mechanisms are known to be used by the device or the firmware itself to check the integrity of the code.\n\n",

        "abstract": "We reverse-engineered one implementation of the non-public CHIASMUS cipher designed by the German Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, short BSI). This did not only give us some insight on the cipher, but also uncovered serious implementation issues in GSTOOL which allow attackers to crack files encrypted with the GSTOOL encryption function with very little effort.",
        "description": "In the dark ages of digital cryptography, when ciphers were considered export-controlled munitions and AES was not yet standardized, the German Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, short BSI) decided to invent their own ciphers: CHIASMUS for software implementations and LIBELLE, which would be kept secret and only implemented in hardware.\n\nCHIASMUS is not publicly documented. It is implemented in a software tool of the same name, released by the BSI, which is only available where there is a public interest for its use. However, the GSTOOL, a database application for security audit management also released by the BSI, contains an encryption feature using the CHIASMUS block cipher, and is freely available. This software was developed by a third party, Steria Mummert Consulting, and apparently was not properly reviewed.\n\nWe disassembled and analyzed the GSTOOL to obtain the specification for the encrypted files (and thus the CHIASMUS cipher itself), but we got more than we bargained for. While the cipher itself appears to be pretty secure, the implementation is a collection of rookie mistakes and a great example of what can (and will) go wrong if you ask people with little understanding of cryptography to build cryptographic software and don't verify their results.\n\nWe invite you to enjoy this thriller full of historic backgrounds, non-public public announcements, legal threats, weapons-grade stupidity, and a very simple solution for complex crypotographic problems. Facepalm with us on the two-year long hunt for the elusive security patch! Have a look at the (not-so-secret-anymore) CHIASMUS block cipher! Learn why you should not build your own crypto tools unless you really know what you are doing, even if you use a known algorithm. And what happens when government contractors attempt to do so. And then attempt to fix it.\n\n(Note: Since this is an implementation issue, the stand-alone Chiasmus software tool is not affected by this issue.)",

        "description": "Most automated teller machines (ATMs) run regular Windows systems and can be controlled like any other computer. The first public demonstration of an ATM hack was given in 2010 - but how bad is this threat really? It turns out there is a multi-million dollar business behind ATM hacks. This talk reveals how these criminal gangs operate by disclosing information obtained through forensic analysis of a real compromise.\n\nIn the analyzed case some malware was used to control the hacked machine that was written specifically for the targeted ATM brand. By reverse-engineering this malware, we gained unique insights into the technologies used by the intruders. The malicious features range from balance monitoring over cash-out commands to the wiping of the machine to cover up traces of the attack. They can be accessed through special number codes that are entered directly via the machine's number pad. Hooking techniques and overlay windows are used to display the status of the system on the ATM monitor.\n\nWe will further discuss that operations of this scale can only be performed by professional crime groups that not only have the technical capabilities to develop such special malware, but also have access to insider information about the design of ATMs and who know how the targeted banks operate.",

Both the hardware and the software landscape has completely changed since then. In this talk we would like to take the chance, together with the audience, to look back on how the OpenWrt distribution did evolve over time and how it has changed its goals, its processes and its software stack. \nWe will show examples of the current state-of-the-art, invite guests on stage, display things to come. And in general, celebrate that 10 years have passed and that many more are to come.\nThe talk will start by looking back into the ancient history of OpenWrt - how it all got started - continue to the present time and give an overview of current and recent developments and then finish with an outlook onto future changes. During the talk we will look at the politics of what we have learned, what we think is broken in the CPE market, and how OpenWrt can help to change this. \nOpenWrt has, over the course of the past 10 years, created a territory of its own, a territory situated in a landscape criscrossed by relations, friction and interconnections. It is a journey that on its way created an universal embedded Linux operating system.

The well-known standards mentioned here will be OpenMP and OpenMPI. And then I will show you the hardware-close programming languages CUDA and OpenCL. I will also mention OpenACC and C++AMP as one possible way towards more abstraction and better code maintainability.\nAll of them allow to program accelerator cards with or without some safeguards in place. But because every accelerator card is different in how to reach its maximum speed, I will also cover some fundamental card architectures and their pitfalls.\n\nAt the end of the talk, you will be able to map your problem to one (or both) of the parallelism concepts, have a first idea how to get started ... and if it is worth the work.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you there!",

        "abstract": "The use of encryption to secure sensitive data from unauthorized eyes is as old as human communication itself. Before the relatively new method of computerized encryption software converting data into a format unintelligible to anyone lacking the necessary key for its decryption, for a long time there was pen and paper and the human brain doing quite a bit of work. Up until the 20th century encryption had to be done literally by hand, to then be transmitted in paper form, via telegraphy or radio. In this context, encryption of data has always been of special importance during times of political conflict and war; subsequently, it saw its major developments during those times in history. This talk will examine and explain common hand encryption methods still employed today using the example of one very successful Soviet espionage group operating in Japan in the 1930s and 1940s: the spy ring centered around Richard Sorge, codenamed \u201cRamsay\u201d.",
        "description": "In the summer of 1938, the Japanese Secret Police started to notice mysterious radio transmissions emanating from somewhere in the Tokyo area. These transmissions, consisting of seemingly meaningless groups of digits, seemed to be directed towards the Asian mainland; neither the Secret Police nor the Japanese Communications Ministry and the Communications Bureau of the Governor General of Korea were able to pinpoint the where and from more precisely. It wasn't until 1941 that Japanese authorities uncovered the full scope and meaning of these messages \u2013 by accident and at first disbelieving what they had unearthed.\n\nThe seemingly gibberish radio transmissions did indeed emanate from the heart of Tokyo and, as it turned out, were received in Vladivostok and passed on to Moscow, to be presented to Stalin himself. Decrypted, they contained vital information about secret German and Japanese plans, even the date of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. This information had been gathered by Richard Sorge, a German citizen with a colorful personality who had infiltrated the small German community in Japan under the guise of a journalist and even gained the friendship and trust of the German ambassador, giving him access to any information available inside the embassy of Japan's ally.\n\nIn Japan since 1933, Sorge had built a spy ring around a small group of confidantes: a Japanese journalist with connections to powerful Japanese political circles, a French-Yugoslav communist, and a German radio technician, Max Clausen.\n\nClausen's technical knowledge proved vital for the group's success: he was able to build a transmitter and receiver capable of reaching up to 4,000 km from scratch, using parts available in Tokyo shops without raising suspicion. His radio station was fully portable in a large briefcase and assembled in under 10 minutes.\n\nThe dispatches transmitted to the Soviet Union by Sorge's group were written in English and then converted into digits using a straddling checkerboard and, to scramble the content even more, a book cipher, using pages from a statistical yearbook as the key. The Japanese authorities were not able to decipher the messages, Sorge's encryption method remained unbroken until Max Clausen explained it himself after his arrest in 1941.\n\nThe historical importance of Sorge's espionage material remains a controversial issue among historians; some call him the greatest spy of all times, some argue that since Stalin did not trust his information, Sorge had little influence on the outcome of World War II. Instead of trying to settle this argument, my talk will examine the technical aspects of Sorge's work in Japan: I will describe the DIY radio station used to wirelessly transmit his dispatches over thousands of kilometers and show how these dispatches were manually encrypted using nothing but a pen, paper, and a book \u2013 suggesting that this method is still valid today, offering low-tech ways of concealing information, be it private or politically delicate material.",

        "abstract": "Symbolic Execution (SE) is a powerful way to analyze programs. Instead of using concrete data values SE uses symbolic values to evaluate a large set of parallel program paths at once. A drawback of many systems is that they need source code access and only scale to few lines of code. This talk explains how SE and binary analysis can be used to (i) reverse-engineer components of binary only applications and (ii) construct specific concrete input that triggers a given condition deep inside the application (think of defining an error condition and the SE engine constructs the input to the application that triggers the error).",
        "description": "Analysis and reverse engineering of binary programs is cumbersome. Consider the problem that we have a given interesting (error) condition inside the program that we want to trigger. How can we generate a specific input to the program that, during the execution of the program, will trigger the condition. In this talk we use a combination of binary analysis techniques that recover high-level control-flow and data-flow information from a binary-only application and Symbolic Execution (SE) to automate the analysis of such problems. Existing SE tools have often been used to achieve high coverage across all code paths in an application to find implementation bugs. We use SE for a different purpose; given a vulnerability condition hidden deep inside the application what is the input that triggers that condition.\n\nWe tackle the given problem in three major steps: (i) gathering information about the binary, (ii) analyzing the information-flow and control-flow of the binary, and (iii) using symbolic execution to generate a specific input example that triggers the specified condition. During the information gathering process we define the interesting condition and use regular analysis techniques to set-up later stages. In the information-flow and control-flow analysis we use a given sample input to collect a complete execution trace of the application that is then parsed into a graph that dissects the computation of the application into individual components. The last steps uses fuzzBall, our open-source SE engine to compute specific vulnerability-triggering inputs for the identified components.\n\nTo evaluate our technique we will show several examples using real programs, showing how we can use specific vulnerability conditions to automatically generate input that triggers this condition. In addition, we will show how our SE engine can be used for other interesting analysis on binary only applications. Our tools are available as open-source and we invite other hackers to join in on this project.",

        "subtitle": "Velocipedes and Face Recognition",
        "abstract": "This talk considers the use of new technology to police large crowds in the Romantic period. We examine ethical aspects of modern surveillance technologies by looking at debates around crowd control and face recognition in the age that first imagined, and reflected on, the surveillance state.",
        "description": "1819 saw a craze in Britain for German mechanic Karl Von Drais\u2019s Laufmaschine \u2013 a two-wheeled, peddleless wooden precursor of the bicycle dubbed \u201cvelocipede\u201d or \u201cdandy charger\u201d. As well as recreational uses, military and police applications were quickly proposed for this futuristic technology. On 1 September 1819, The Tickler magazine imagined squadrons of \u201cDandy Dragoons\u201d being used to police \u201cpublic spectacles\u201d. There was a serious point beneath the humour. Just two weeks earlier, brutal policing by soliders on horseback led to the deaths of protestors at a public meeting that became known as the Peterloo Massacre. We consider the Drais-maschine as a \u201chacked horse\u201d, but one that caused public anxiety as well as fashionable interest. We consider Romantic debates around the proposed use of velocipedes for \u201chome service\u201d, since they strikingly anticipate contemporary discussions about drone deployment in homeland security contexts. We ask what light these early debates throw on our own misgivings about the \u201cteching-up\u201d of surveillance agencies.\n\nWe look at two \u201cpublic spectacles\u201d in the Romantic period. The first is the \u201cTriumphant Entry into London\u201d on 13 September 1819 of popular radical politician Henry Hunt to answer treason charges following his participation at Peterloo. The poet John Keats was among the 30,000-strong crowd who lined the streets to welcome him, and from his letters we have an eyewitness account. The second \u2013 related \u2013 \u201cpublic spectacle\u201d is imagined in a painting entitled \u201cChrist\u2019s Triumphant Entry into Jerusalem\u201d by Keats\u2019s friend B. R. Haydon. Haydon included Keats\u2019s face in the crowd, as well as those of other poets and philosophers, including Voltaire and Newton. Critics of the painting referred to the \u201cgross anachronism\u201d of their presence \u2013 in another sense, though, they are merely in the wrong place, at the wrong time (Zur falschen Zeit am falschen Ort). Both spectacles offer a bridge to a consideration of ethical aspects to C21 surveillance technology.\n\nThe final part of our talk focuses on Romanticism\u2019s understanding of the interpretive role of face recognition. Modern software promises to turn facial features into objective, mathematical space, though arguably fails to move beyond the subjective heuristic space into which viewers of Haydon\u2019s canvas were invited two hundred years ago. Modern face-tracking software\u2019s act of recognition is always an act of imagining the subject\u2019s relation to wrong-doing. The identified face in the crowd summons his or her \u201cunenrolled\u201d Doppelg\u00e4nger, where individuals occupy a quantum-like state of uncertainty until a measurement is made against a crime \u2013 a problem to which Haydon\u2019s painting seems supremely attuned.\n\nThe talk as a whole builds on our previous exploration at 29C3 of ways in which post-Enlightenment art, poetry and political philosophy is relevant to C21 discussions about surveillance culture.\n\n\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\nProfessor Richard Marggraf Turley is Professor of Engagement with the Public Imagination at Aberystwyth University.

This work investigates building and running an RF scanner array for monitoring and spectrum mapping using cheap SDR devices. The array allows for both RF sampling and power analysis to be split over multiple systems in order to increase capture and spectrum analysis capabilities. The system allows for \"strong signal capture\" as well as, simply, signal modeling with \"strong signal alerting\". Also discussed will be using the array versus USRPs and the issue of antennae for all of the devices. I will explain the mistakes I made in building the array and what I did to attempt toovercome such pitfalls. The code for running the array will be introduced and released for public consumption. In addition, while we target the RTL-SDR devices, we will discuss the feasibility of including non-traditional SDR hardware in the array, including non-Realtek tuner cards and inclusion of HackRF devices.",

        "description": "People increasingly track their physical fitness, from step counting over recording sports exercises to monitoring their food intake (e.g. Fitbit, Runkeeper, LooseIt). People are more aware of their routine, let\u2019s them improve their physical life, fostering better eating and exercise habits, decreasing the risk for any obesity related diseases, increasing the quality of life.  Physical activity recognition is becoming mainstream. \n\nTraditionally, research in activity recognition has focused on identifying physical tasks performed by the user through setting up elaborate, dedicated sensors in the lab. Yet, in recent years, physical activity recognition has become more mainstream. As industry begins to apply advances suggested by activity recognition research, we see more and more commercial products that help people track their physical fitness, from simple step counting (e.g., Fitbit One, Misfit Shine, Nike Fuelband, Withings Pulse) over sports expertise tracking (e.g. Runkeeper, Strava) to sleep monitoring.\nWe see also the first smartphone applications giving users an overview about their activities, for example \u201cHuman\u201d and \u201cMove\u201d, just to name two. Their tracking abilities are still limited by the battery power of today\u2019s smart phones. Yet, with the just announced M7 Chip in the new iPhone 5s (making it easy to aggregate and interpret sensor data in a power efficient manner), we can expect physical activity tracking will be sooner or later integrated in our smart phones and other everyday appliances.\n\nWhile people explored the problem of physical activity recognition thoroughly, the ability to detect cognitive activities is an area with many challenges. This exciting new research field, Cognitive Quantified Self, opens up new opportunities at the intersection of wearable computing, machine learning, psychology, and cognitive science. In this talk I  focus on tracking reading (the cognitive process of decoding letters, words, and sentences) in a mobile setting using optical eye tracking and occasionally first person vision (a camera worn on the users head).\n\nWe want to establish long-term tracking of many mental processes suggesting strategies to optimize mental fitness and cognitive well-being.\n\nImagine, educators can get real-time feedback about the attention level and learning progress of their students, giving them a good grasp on already understood and potential difficult concepts. Learning material can be redesigned and tailored towards the needs of the individual student, given their reading/learning history, their preferences and life-style.\n\nContent creators can use the quantified mind logs as a basis for improving their works. In which part of the movie are users most attentive? What feelings are conveyed by a particular paragraph in a book convey? In case you are a researcher, wouldn\u2019t you like to know at what sentence a reader looses interest in your grant proposal?\n\nAnd we finally can tackle more difficult to analyze lifestyle issues, given a large enough user group and good enough sensing. e.g. How do sleep and eating habits influence our attention and learning?\n",

        "description": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is vital for access to information on the Web. It is thus a target for attackers trying to suppress free access to information. This talk introduces the design and implementation of the GNU Name System (GNS), a fully decentralized and censorship-resistant name system.  GNS provides an privacy-enhancing alternative to DNS and existing public key infrastructures (such as X.509 certificate authorities), while giving users the desirable property of memorable names.  The design of GNS incorporates the possibility of integration and coexistence with DNS.\n\nGNS builds on ideas from the Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure (SDSI), addressing a central issue with the decentralized mapping of secure identifiers to memorable names: namely the impossibility of providing a global, secure and memorable mapping without a trusted authority, also known as Zooko's triangle. GNS uses the transitivity in the SDSI design to replace the trusted root with secure delegation of authority, thus making petnames useful to other users while operating under the strong adversary model assumed by Zooko.\n\nIn addition to describing the GNS design, this talk also discusses some of the mechanisms that are needed to smoothly integrate GNS with existing processes and procedures in Web browsers.  Specifically, we show how GNS is able to transparently support many assumptions that the existing HTTP(S) infrastructure makes about globally unique names.\n",

We present a brief theoretical explanation of Firmware Fat Camp, a collection of \"before\" and \"after\" photos of graduates of FFC, along with a set of live demonstrations of FFC in action on common embedded devices.\n\nModern embedded systems such as VoIP phones, network printers and routers typically ship with all available features compiled into its firmware image. A small subset of these features is activated at any given time on individual devices based on its specific configuration. An even smaller subset of features is actually used, as some unused and insecure features cannot are typically enabled by default and cannot be disabled. However, all embedded devices still contain a large amount of code and data that should never be executed or read according to its current configuration. This unnecessary binary is not simply a waste of memory; it contains vulnerable code and data that can be used by an attacker to exploit the system. This \u201cdead code\u201d provides an ideal attack surface. Automated minimization of this attack surface will significantly improve the security of the device without any impact to the device\u2019s functionality. ",
        "description": "We propose a set of methods of hardening existing embedded systems against attack by employing Binary Autotomy or the automated removal of unnecessary binaries from each embedded device according to its current configuration. \n\nThe configuration of the embedded device to be protected is analyzed. The firmware binary corresponding to the features enabled in the configuration is kept. The firmware corresponding to features not enabled in the configuration is removed from the firmware image. The firmware to be removed is determined by applying static and dynamic binary code analysis on the original firmware image. This analysis maps each configurable feature with a set of binary executable code within the firmware image. When a particular configuration is analyzed, a list of enabled features is built from this file. Using the feature to code mapping created from the original dynamic and static analysis, autotomic binary reduction simply removes all code that belongs to features that are not enabled, or should not be used, in the particular configuration file in question. \n\nWe present quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of Binary Autotomy algorithms on a collection of common embedded devices along with several live demonstrations of embedded devices running post FFC firmware images.

        "description": "Attribute Based Credentials (ABC) allow users to prove certain properties about themselves (e.g. age, race, license, etc.) without revealing their full identity. They provide unlinkability, both between issuance of the credential and subsequebtly proving ownership of the credential, as well as between subsequent ownership proces at a service provider. This makes it impossible to track a user as she uses her credentials on the web. This makes ABCs a powerful privacy enhancing technology.\n\nSmart cards are an appealing container to store such credenentials: they are secure, and can be caried by the user in an ordinary wallet. However, ABC use complex cryptography to achieve their privacy preserving properties, thus far evading efficient implementations on such smart cards. The IRMA (I Reveal My Attributes) project of the Radboud University Nijmegen (together with SURFnet and TNO) has created the first full and efficient implementation of this technology on smart cards. The implementation is based on the Idemix technology orginally developed by IBM. The smart card is contactless, to allow NFC enabled smart phones and tablets as readers. This makes it easy to use IRMA cards on the web, or to prove credentials in a small shop on the tablet owned by the shopkeeper. \n\nWe will discuss ABCs in general, the IRMA system and it's implementation particular, and give a demo of how an IRMA card can be used in practice (using a smart phone as the card reader). More importantly though we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of ABC technology, compared to other identity management approaches. We will especially discuss the risk of having a ubiquitous authentication infrastructure that ABCs would provide when implemented on national identity cards, and outline ways to mitigate these risks.\n",

Ein gigantisches Ausma\u00df an \u00dcberwachung durch die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika tut sich auf, weltweit. In Europa ist die Bundesrepublik  Deutschland das am meisten \u00fcberwachte Land.",
        "description": "Ein Blick in die Geschichte zeigt: Die Aff\u00e4re ist keineswegs ein singul\u00e4res Ereignis. Sie ist vielmehr der bisherige H\u00f6hepunkt in einer \u00fcber sechzigj\u00e4hrigen Geschichte der \u00dcberwachung Deutschlands. Seit dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs wird dieses Land systematisch \u00fcberwacht. Die Bundesrepublik ist wichtiges Angriffsziel, aber auch wichtiger Partner der amerikanischen Geheimdienste. Verfassungsschutz und Bundesnachrichtendienst sind Ziehkinder der amerikanischen und britischen Besatzungsm\u00e4chte, zu engster Zusammenarbeit und zum Austausch aller Nachrichten, einschlie\u00dflich personenbezogener Daten, bis heute verpflichtet.\n\nOhne einen Blick in die Geschichte ist die aktuelle Aff\u00e4re kaum zu verstehen. Mit seinem Buch \u201e\u00dcberwachtes Deutschlands\u201c, das neun Monate vor Beginn der NSA-Aff\u00e4re erschienen ist, hat der Freiburger Historiker Josef Foschepoth historisch-politisches Neuland betreten. Erstmals wird deutlich, wie stark die Westm\u00e4chte auf die innere Entwicklung der Bundesrepublik eingewirkt haben, um ihren Anspruch auf \u00dcberwachung in Deutschland und von Deutschland aus dauerhaft zu sichern. Um das zu erm\u00f6glichen, wurde 1968 das Grundrecht auf Unverletzlichkeit des Post- und Fernmeldegeheimnis stark eingeschr\u00e4nkt, die Gewaltenteilung aufgehoben und der Rechtsweg ausgeschlossen. So entstand ein gewaltiger deutsch-alliierter geheimdienstlicher Komplex, der sich jeder Kontrolle entzieht. Der Schl\u00fcssel zum Verst\u00e4ndnis der sechzigj\u00e4hrigen Geschichte der \u00dcberwachung liegt in dem strikten Geheimhaltungsgebot, auf das sich beide Seiten immer wieder verpflichteten.\n\nWelche Konsequenzen hatte das alles f\u00fcr Rechtsstaatlichkeit und Souver\u00e4nit\u00e4t der zweiten deutschen Republik? Welche Konsequenzen ergeben sich aus den fortgesetzten Angriffen auf die freiheitlich-demokratische Ordnung der Bundesrepublik? Warum schweigt die Bundesregierung zu den elementaren Bedrohungen der verfassungsm\u00e4\u00dfig garantierten Grundfreiheiten und Grundrechten? Warum arbeitet sie an einem \u201eAnti-Spionage-Abkommen\u201c und l\u00e4sst gleichzeitig den Bau eines hochmodernen Spionagezentrums f\u00fcr die amerikanischen Geheimdienste auf deutschem Boden in Wiesbaden-Erbenheim zu? Wie rechtsstaatlich und wie souver\u00e4n ist das am meisten \u00fcberwachte Land in Europa?\n\nIn seinem Vortrag er\u00f6rtert Josef Foschepoth die historischen Grundlagen und die notwendigen Konsequenzen, die sich aus diesen und vielen anderen Fragen ergeben.",

        "abstract": "In the chain of trust of most secure schemes is an electronic chip that holds secret information. These schemes often employ cryptographically secure protocols. The weakest link of such a scheme is the chip itself. By attacking the chip directly an attacker can gain access to the secret data in its unencrypted form. In this presentation we demonstrate the attack class of the future, backside attacks. This class of attacks mitigate all device countermeasures and can access all signals of the device. As opposed to the attacks of today, these attacks can also be applied to complex systems such as the ARM SoCs of modern smartphones.",
        "description": "Over recent years hackers and chip manufacturers have been deadlocked in the field of integrated circuit security. From reverse engineering proprietary cryptographic algorithms and microprobing bus lines to fault injection and side cannel attacks, every class of attack has ushered in new preventative countermeasures. Most attacks to date are performed from the frontside where all the active areas and circuit nodes are accesible. Hence, all countermeasures, such as shields and meshes, also  focus on mitigating attacks from the frontside. Security relevant signals are burried under many layers of metalization to make them inaccessible to frontside attackers.\nThe direct consequence is that backside attacks become significantly more appealing. With comprably little effort, many old-school attacks are once again possible. Setting or resetting fuses, probing wires or even single transistors is possible, not only with needles but with electron beams or lasers. More exotic attacks are feasible from the backside as well. For example, in switching transistors some of the electrons induce photons that can be seen with an infrared camera during execution. The opposite, i.e. iducing laser light, can also result in successful glitching attacks.\nCurrently, there are is little IC vendors can do to prevent such attacks.",

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "Internet-wide network scanning has powerful security applications, including exposing new vulnerabilities, tracking their mitigation, and exposing hidden services.  Unfortunately, probing the entire public address space with standard tools like Nmap requires either months of time or large clusters of machines.  In this talk, I'll demonstrate <a href=\"https://zmap.io\">ZMap</a>, an open-source network scanner developed by my research group that is designed from the ground up to perform Internet-wide scans efficiently.  We've used ZMap with a gigabit Ethernet uplink to survey the entire IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes from a single machine, more than 1300 times faster than Nmap.  I'll explain how ZMap's architecture enables such high performance.  We'll then work through a series of practical examples that explore the security applications of very fast Internet-scale scanning, both offensive and defensive.  I'll talk about results and experiences from conducting more than 300 Internet-wide scans over the past 18 months, including new revelations about the state of the HTTPS CA ecosystem.  I'll discuss the reactions our scans have generated--on one occasion we were mistaken for an Iranian attack against U.S. banks and we received a visit from the FBI--and I'll suggest guidelines and best practices for good Internet citizenship while scanning.",
        "description": "Internet-scale network surveys collect data by probing large subsets of the public IP address space.  While such scanning behavior is often associated with botnets and worms, it also has proved to be a powerful methodology for security research.  Recent studies, beginning with the EFF's SSL Observatory, have demonstrated that Internet-wide scanning can help reveal new kinds of vulnerabilities, monitor deployment of mitigations, and shed light on previously opaque distributed ecosystems.  Unfortunately, this methodology has been more accessible to attackers than to researchers without access to botnets or willingness to spread self-replicating code.  Comprehensively scanning the public address space with off-the-shelf tools like Nmap requires weeks of time or many machines.\n\nTo make Internet-wide scanning more accessible, my research team recently introduced <a href=\"https://zmap.io\">ZMap</a>, an open-source network scanner that is designed from the ground up to perform Internet-scale port scans.  In our tests using a gigabit Ethernet uplink, ZMap scans the entire IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes from a single machine, more than 1300 times faster than Nmap.  By the time of the talk, we'll have switched to a 10 gigE uplink, which should theoretically support scanning the entire address space in under 5 minutes.  I'll explain how ZMap's architecture enables such high performance by taking advantage of fast modern hardware and recent improvements to the Linux kernel.\n\nWe'll work through a series of practical examples that explore the security applications of very fast Internet-scale scanning, both offensive and defensive, and I'll share experiences from conducting more than 300 Internet-wide scans over the past 18 months, totaling well over 1 trillion probes.  I'll describe how we completed hundreds of scans targeting every public HTTPS server (each scan larger than the entire SSL Observatory) in order to shed light on the growth of HTTPS deployments and expose security problems within the HTTPS ecosystem, such as misissued CA certs and widespread server misconfiguration.  I'll show how high-speed scanning can be used to expose vulnerable hosts, using IPMI and UPnP vulnerabilities as recent examples.  Malicious attackers could abuse this capability to exploit 0day vulnerabilities affecting millions of hosts within hours of a problem's discovery, and better defenses are badly needed.  Finally, I'll discuss applications to Internet freedom, including discovering unadvertised services such as hidden Tor bridges (used for censorship resistance) and Bluecoat devices (used for state-sponsored censorship).\n\nHigh-speed scanning can be a powerful tool in the hands of security researchers, but users must be careful not to cause harm by inadvertently overloading networks or causing unnecessary work for network administrators.  I'll discuss the complaints and other reactions my group's scanning has generated--on one occasion we were mistaken for an Iranian DoS attack on U.S. banks, and we received a visit from the FBI--and I'll suggest several guidelines and best practices for good Internet citizenship while scanning.\n\nWe are living in a unique period in the history of the Internet: widely available networks are becoming fast enough to quickly and exhaustively scan the IPv4 address space, yet IPv6 (with its much larger address space) has not yet been widely deployed.  I hope this talk will help researchers make the most of this window of opportunity. \n",

Would we be safe from run-away computation if only well-formed inputs to each of the individual tools were allowed? Not so. Potential for malicious computation lurks in a variety of input formats along all steps of the binary runtime process construction and execution. Until the \"glue\" data of an ABI and the binary toolchains in general is reduced to predictable, statically analyzable power, plenty of room for bug-less Trojans remains.\n\nWe will discuss our latest work in constructing Turing-complete computation out of different levels of metadata, present tools to normalize and disambiguate these metadata, and conclude with proposals for criteria to trust binary toolchains beyond \"Trusting trust\" compilers and planted bugs.",
        "description": "This talk develops on our previous \"weird machines\" work published in WOOT 2013, https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot13/woot13-shapiro.pdf and \nhttps://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot13/woot13-bangert.pdf\n(video & slides at https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot13/tech-schedule/workshop-program) We will look at the elements of runtime that are typically overlooked as \"mere engineering\", and show that without restricting these to statically predictable computing power no trust in the toolchain is possible, i.e., a computation can be hijacked from a \"signed\" image even before it starts executing. In particular, we will show how parser differentials between images as verified and as loaded, or as seen by the kernel and the RTLD can result in completely different view of the loadable segments (and, as a result, of the runtime space).

Several decades ago the correspondence between logics and programming (Curry-Howard) was found. This correspondence is now being used in modern programming languages using dependent types, such as Agda, Coq, and Idris.\n\nIn this talk I show our development of attacks and security notions within Agda, using the recent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BREACH_%28security_exploit%29\">BREACH</a> exploit as an example. Our development is a constructive step towards verified software and bridges a gap between theory and practice.\nI will explain the details about the Curry-Howard correspondence.\nThe target audience are interested people with some programming experience.",

Indeed the length of the ciphertext can now be controlled by the adversary who can control the plaintext. I will show how this intuitive result can be formalized using <a href=\"http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/\">Agda</a>.</p>\n<p>A note on <a href=\"http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/\">Agda</a>: It is both a programming language and a proof system. The programming language features pure, exhaustive, and terminating functions over rich user defined data types (inductive and co-inductive). This powerful \u03bb-calculus is equipped with a rich type-system featuring dependent-types. Through the Curry-Howard correspondence this programming language can also be used as a proof system. With such a combined system it becomes possible to write programs and proofs about these programs in a unified way. Additionally using this approach, one can start proving properties starting only with programming skills and gradually learn more proof techniques by exploring the type system.</p>\n<p>I claim that functional programming and dependent types can be of a great help to formalize cryptography and thus privacy enhancing tools. I will present how functions are convenient at describing these games and adversaries. I will also give an overview of the crypto-agda project: how type-isomorphisms can ease probabilistic reasoning; how circuits can help capturing the requirements on the complexity bounds; and how all of these aspects can fit together thanks to polymorphism!</p>\n",

As it turned out, the inaudibly quiet distortion, probably caused by the radio\u2019s stereo demuxer circuitry, contained all the information needed to decode all RDS data present in the transmission. I will demonstrate the journey I took and give a short introduction to how the data is actually encoded.

For example, competition between family car makers works, because customers can actually choose different family cars and yet be able to travel to the same places on the same roads, and using the same kinds of fuels.\n\nSimilarly, competition in areas of web browsers and e-mail providers works because regardless of which web browser you choose or with which e-mail provider you set-up your account, you will be able to access the whole web and to contact users of all other providers.\n\nThis, however, is not the case with closed social networks.

The financial resources allocated to this task however are ridiculously small.\n\nThis talk is going to highlight\n<ul>\n<li>why it would be a jolly good idea to take space expansion seriously\n<li>what current technology can already do\n<li>what humanity currently \"uses\" its resources on\n<li>which political institution we should prod\n</ul>",

        "abstract": "Side-channel analysis (SCA) and related methods exploit physical characteristics of a (cryptographic) implementations to bypass security mechanisms and extract secret keys. Yet, SCA is often considered a purely academic exercise with no impact on real systems. In this talk, we show that this is not the case: Using the example of several wide-spread real-world devices, we demonstrate that even seemingly secure systems can be attacked by means of SCA with limited effort.  ",
        "description": "This talk briefly introduces implementation attacks and side-channel analysis (SCA) in particular. Typical side-channels like the power consumption and the EM emanation are introduced. The main focus is then on three case studies that have been conducted as part of the SCA research of the Chair for Embedded Security (Ruhr-Uni Bochum) since 2008:\n\nThe first example are FPGAs that can be protected against reverse-engineering and product counterfeit with a feature called \"bitstream encryption\". Although the major vendors (Xilinx and Altera) use secure ciphers like AES, no countermeasures against SCA were implemented. \nAs a second example, a wide-spread electronic locking system based on proprietary cryptography is analyzed. The target of the third case study is a popular one-time password token for two-factor authentication, the Yubikey 2.\n\nIn all three cases, the cryptographic secrets could be recovered within a few minutes to a few hours of measurements, allowing an adversary to decrypt FPGA bitstreams, to clone Yubikeys, and to open all locks in an entire installation, respectively. \n\nIn conclusion, we summarize possible countermeasures against the presented attacks and describe the communication with the respective vendors as part of a responsible disclosure process.

        "description": "Snapping a photo captures more than just image data. Information about the camera and its lens, shutter speed and aperture, date and time, &c, have been bundled into the JPEG since the early days of digital photography. By now, that photo is likely to include a GPS trace as well, and as soon as it leaves your camera, computers are hard at work assisting you in identifying and tagging people and places, with auto-completing textual clarity and database precision. Meanwhile NSA spooks try to reassure us that they are only interested in the <i>metadata</i> of our communications--the who and the when, and maybe some keywords. Without denying a power and efficacy to machine-readable metadata, I argue that for humans to navigate and find meaning in unknown and unsorted material, this search will require multi-media tools that immerse us and augment our powers of perception, rather than reduce all navigation to textfields, transcripts, and tags. For temporal media (sound and video), codecs have given us greater and greater instantaneous fidelity, but leave us with few techniques to skim, seek, and survey.\n\nUsing case studies of documentary film, Freedom of Information Law document dumps, soundbanks, and a hacker conference, I will demonstrate experiments and results of several years developing open source tools to reorient the idea of documentary around its documents.",

In proper style of a home-delivery-service, anyone who picked up their telephone, was able to listen to the on-going opera performances for as long as s/he wanted through a live connection with the audio bug signal. The Zurich Opera launched a search for the bugs and in a first reaction threatened to take legal action if the transmissions were not stopped and the bugs not removed. \n\n\u00abDelivery for Mr. Assange\u00bb is a live mail art piece.

It was a crash course that got you barely started in a \"I will throw you out of a plane and during the fall I will not just explain to you how to attach the parachute to your body, but maybe before we splash on the ground you might actually be able to open it as well\" way.\n\nSome of the problems to learn to program an FPGA are certainly caused by the complexity that is involved in thinking HW vs. SW. The other problems however can easily be addressed, such as providing an IDE that is actually pleasant to use AND guides the user towards solving his problem by meaningful error message and helpful documentation. You can't do that with VHDL because the language is too fucked up.\n\nSo in this lecture I want to propose a new language that has a much better syntax similar to C, so that most developers will easily understand it. Yet at the same time it is very powerful to get even complicated jobs done. Additionally, you will not need to install anything to start playing with it.\n\nThe big picture here is that I want to create the Arduino for FPGAs and I need your help to get there.",

        "description": "Since our first Mate harvest in 2009, we have been performing the indigenous Guarani mythology of the Mate Goddess Caayari in a Butoh context. This performance has been readapted for the context of the Congress, reinforcing how the connecting and communication aspects of Mate help hackers on the data highway to focus and make synergies.\n\nOnce upon a time an ailing Guarani Indian left behind by his tribe discovered a plant that rejuvenated him and made him feel young again. This magical drink that he made from the leaves of the Mate Tree took on the spirit of the Goddess Caayari who kept him company in his solitude and gave him strength and inspiration.\n\nFrom flashing back to the mate mythology, forward to 30C3, Mate today plays a different role, captured in a bottle and beloved by hackers who drink mate to concentrate and connect on the Net. Just as the Guarani tribes used to drink Mate together a long time ago around the fire and exchange information, and South American communities come together to pass a mate cuia around; today Mate plays a vital role in the social aspect of gatherings such as the Congress.\n\nRaven and Fabricio do Canto have performed the Caayari mythology for audiences in India and Lebanon, and more recently, Fabricio has integrated parts from the performance into his Mate lectures. Their expressionistic interpretation of the origins of the Caayari Mate Mythology will be followed by a Mate Circle.\n",

        "subtitle": "by xobs & bunnie",
        "abstract": "All \u201cmanaged FLASH\u201d devices, such as SD, microSD, and SSD, contain an embedded controller to assist with the complex tasks necessary to create an abstraction of reliable, contiguous storage out of FLASH silicon that is fundamentally unreliable and unpredictably fragmented. This controller is an attack surface of interest. First, the ability to modify the block allocation and erasure algorithms introduces the opportunity to perform various MITM attacks in a virtually undetectable fashion. Second, the controller itself is typically powerful, with performance around 50MIPS, yet with a cost of mere pennies, making it an interesting and possibly useful development target for other non-storage related purposes. Finally, understanding the inner workings of the controller enables opportunities for data recovery in cards that are thought to have been erased, or have been partially damaged.\n\nThis talk demonstrates a method for reverse engineering and loading code into the microcontroller within a SD memory card.",
        "description": "TECHNICAL APPROACH\n\nPublicly available documentation on SD card controllers is scarce.  However, based upon tear-down and decap analysis as well as a survey of the publicly available product briefs, most controllers are believed to be either an enhanced 8051, or an ARM derivative.\n\nA further challenge to overcome is the fact that SD card manufacturers typically reserve the right to change the controller IC within a card without updating the external markings to reflect the change. This policy favors the SD card manufacturers, as it allows them to swap out existing controllers for lower-cost devices as new controllers are introduced. However, it is problematic for users as it means that two otherwise identical looking cards can have different performance and/or bugs with which to contend.\n\nTo kick off the effort, a survey of available cards was made at an SD card gray market in Shenzhen, China. Each card was dissected and visually inspected for cues, such as the layout of the traces going to the controller glob-top, that would indicate the type of controller within.  About a dozen different controller types were identified, of which one was picked for further investigation due to its use of SLC FLASH memory.  SLC is a good starting point for reverse engineering because no storage-level scrambling is required to prevent the read and write-disturb issues typical of MLC and TLC FLASH.\n\nA simple binary dump of the FLASH memory within the card revealed structure within the first erase block consistent with what we might expect for code storage. Since FLASH memory is inherently unreliable, four CRC + ECC protected copies of code are located within the first sector. This crude duplication scheme allows the card to boot even if bit errors creep into the code storage sector. We also noted the existence of the string \u201cBUILDWIN\u201d within the code storage sector, which indicates that the controller is likely from a series made by a company called Appotech. Product briefs from the Appotech/Buildwin websites indicated that the architecture of the code is likely an 8051-derivative, and the model of the controller is probably an AX211.\n\nAt this point, our effort to reverse engineer the controller split into two paths. One path was static analysis, where extracted binaries and manufacturing-related tools were analyzed with IDA to determine key entry points, storage locations, and most importantly a method for injecting code into the card via the SD interface. The other path was dynamic analysis, where the signals going to the SD card bus and to the NAND FLASH were instrumented with logging and stimulus facilities, and the controller's operation could be observed with exquisite resolution, enabling a broad class of fuzzing and other brute-force analysis attacks, as well as the rapid confirmation or rejection of hypotheses generated by static analysis. Dynamic analysis was key in determining features such as the location of the GPIO control registers and the function and format of otherwise undocumented extended instruction opcodes.\n\nThe static analysis path was assisted by the availability of official firmware burning routines, scavenged from Chinese language file-sharing websites. These are tools normally used during the production of SD cards, but made available on the gray market to enable (and correct) card capacity expansion fraud. Typically, these tools are used to flash an incorrect version of the firmware onto the SD cards, which would identify the card as having a much higher capacity than the physically available storage.  This would allow unscrupulous dealers to sell, for example, aging 128MiB silicon as devices identifying themselves with 2GiB capacity. These bootleg tools would come with a collection of firmware blobs for loading onto the card, as well as a routine that communicates to a proprietary USB-based burning device. We did not have access to the burner, but static analysis of the communication protocol via code reverse engineering revealed that firmware loading is initiated through the application of a specific \u201csecret knock\u201d sequence during card boot.\n\nThe dynamic analysis path was implemented using an embedded platform of our making, known publicly as Novena. It is a quad-core ARM CPU running Linux mated to a Spartan 6 FPGA with a high speed expansion port. The FPGA also has a 256 MiB DDR3 buffer slaved off of it. This buffer + FPGA was used to implement a combination logic analyzer + ROM emulator used to wrap the controller on the SD card. The ROM emulator presents a virtual, dual-ported NAND FLASH device to the SD card controller. The dual-port design allows us to modify and read the contents of the NAND FLASH on the fly, thereby allowing us to stimulate the controller IC with various fault conditions or code loops and measure its effect on the FLASH device. This tight coupling enabled us to rapidly discover, for example, which SFRs (Special Function Registers) are responsible for reading or writing to the Flash controller hardware. Furthermore, each port of the SD card controller is connected to a virtual logic analyzer within the FPGA that can store up to a 16MiB trace of transactions going to and from the controller from both the SD and FLASH buses. This very deep buffer length allowed us to observe behavior of the device from power-on to full operation, as well as observe stimulus-response loops to compound SD bus commands.\n\nSD INTERFACE OVERVIEW\n\nBefore diving into the details of our approach, we review a few important aspects of the SD protocol. When an SD card first boots, it is running in SD/MMC mode.  This is a 9-wire protocol, using the following pinout (note: pin 9 is located below and to the side of pin 1):\n\n 12345678\n9|||||||\\- DAT1\n|||||||\\-- DAT0\n||||||\\--- GND\n|||||\\---- Clock\n||||\\----- VDD +3.3V\n|||\\------ GND\n||\\------- Command\n|\\-------- DAT3\n\\--------- DAT2\n\nSD commands consist of a start bit of 0, a sync bit of 1, a 6-bit command number (referred to as CMDn, where n is between 0 and 63,) four 8-bit arguments, a CRC7 checksum, and a stop-bit of 1. This yields a total of 48-bits (or 6 bytes) per command.\n\nWhile the card is processing the request, it will keep the Command line high, and will begin its communication with a start bit by bringing the Command line low, indicating \"0\". This will be followed by 38 bits of data, 7 bits of crc7, and a stop bit of \"1\", for a total of 48 bits.\n\nBit values are sampled when the clock line is high, and may change when the clock line is low. Bytes are sent from high to low. For example, hex value 0x80 would be written out as 0b10000000. CMD0 must be sent before any other commands are processed. To send such a command, transmit the following six byes.\n\n{0x40 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x95}\n    |    |    |    |    |    \\----- (CRC7 of ({0x40, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00}))<<1 | 1\n    |    \\----\\----\\----\\---------- Four arguments of \"0\"\n    \\------------------------------ Start bit of 0, cmd bit of 1, CMD0)\n\nThen, continue to wiggle the clock, and look for the 48-bit response.  Data is transmitted either on the DAT0 line (for 1-bit mode), or striped in parallel across DAT0-DAT3. As with the Command line, bit 7 is sent first, and bit 0 is sent last. In four-bit mode, DAT3 will send bit 7, DAT2 will send bit 6, DAT1 will send bit 5, and DAT4 will send bit 4.  Bits 3-0 will be sent using DAT3-DAT0 on the next clock cycle.\n\nData is transmitted with a start bit of 0, followed by the data (almost always 512 bytes), followed by a CRC16 of the data, and then a stop bit of 1. In the case of 4-bit mode, all four DAT lines send a start bit of 0, and each individual line sends its own CRC16 of the transmitted data. All four lines send a stop bit of 1, as well.\n\nCONTROLLER-SPECIFIC NOTES\n\nThe AX211 is based on the 8051 architecture, which is an eight-bit processor core that is very common among embedded parts. The original 8051 ran at around 1 MIPS, but improvements in architecture and clock speed allows the 8051 present in the AX211 to run at 50 MIPS. The 8051 instruction set had a single undefined opcode of 0xa5, which is used by Appotech to implement 32-bit instruction set extensions. \n\nThe hardware SD protocol engine only handles transferring bytes (OSI layers 1 & 2). The higher-level details of the SD protocol set is implemented entirely in software, making for a compelling attack surface. When the processor first starts up it attempts to load a valid flash image off of the NAND. While it is in this state, it can respond to a limited set of SD commands, including \"RESET\", \"Set CRC7 required\", and \"Set voltage\". It will not respond to the \"Go Ready\" command until it has loaded its firmware. There are four copies of the AX211 firmware, located at NAND offset 0x0000, 0x10000, 0x20000, and 0x30000. Each copy is protected with its own error correcting code. If all four copies are sufficiently damaged, or if the NAND is missing or blank, then the card will never fully boot, and will never be able to go ready.\n\nFACTORY PROGRAMMER\n\nAs noted previously, we had found a copy of the Windows-based AX211 factory programming tool off of Chinese-language file sharing websites. The full AX211 factory programming suite is a combination of this software and a proprietary (and unknown to us) hardware tool. We suspect the hardware is based on the AppoTech AX2002 processor, which also uses an 8051-compatible instruction set. The device connects to the main PC through USB, and has the USB ID string of \"appotechcksd\". This allows the software to identify the programmer regardless of its product/vendor ID. We believe the device may have a small display, or else it prints debugging information out a serial port. The programming software is almost entirely in Chinese. It does not contain a codepage identifier, so a system must be set to run non-Unicode programs as \"Chinese (PRC)\", which selects an encoding of GB-18030. If you do not do this, the software will display gibberish in place of Chinese text.\n\nThe programmer control software appears to be fully automated. Without the programmer hardware, we can only configure the software and see where, presumably, individual hardware programmers would appear in the user interface. Therefore, we must resort to disassembling the binary to determine how it works. Code flow analysis indicates that when the software initially detects the attachment of factory programming hardware via USB, it opens the device and sends a binary file called \"2005FM.BIN\". 2005FM.BIN is a raw opcode stream that is loaded into the programmer hardware's 8051 (not the SD target) at address 0. The program begins running from address 0, and begins doing some initialization. It then displays the string \"RUN\" through the putative logging interface on the programming hardware. After this, it awaits further control instructions from the host.\n\nThe microcontroller used in the programmer hardware does not contain an SD/MMC host controller. This is fortunate for us, as it means the SD programming interface is implemented entirely using GPIOs. This makes it easy to trace all signal changes through static code analysis.\n\nWhen programming begins, the programmer places the SD card into a special mode where it will accept and execute programs. It does this by sending SD CMD0 (card reset) followed within 20 msec by CMD63 with the arguments 'A' 'P' 'P' 'O' and the appropriate crc7 checksum. The card then responds with the following sequence:\n\n{0x3f 0x00 0x9d 0x20 0x0b 0x35}\n    |    |    |    |    |    \\-- CRC7 checksum, plus stop bit\n    |    \\----\\----\\----\\------- Unknown values\n    \\---------------------------- The command we sent (CMD63)\n\nThe program to be executed on the SD card is then loaded to offset 0x2900, and will begin executing immediately from within an interrupt context. Therefore, the first thing the routine should do is escape the context by changing the return value, then issuing a \"reti\" command.\n\nWhen the host software detects a new card to be programmed, it informs the programmer to put the card into this special factory mode, and then begins uploading firmware and communicating with the card. The first program to get loaded is a small piece of test code called TestBoot.bin.  The program performs a few sanity checks, then returns pass or fail by sending the result out the Command line. Once the program finishes, control returns to the AX211 ROM.\n\nAfter TestBoot.bin runs, the programmer loads a file called communication.bin. This program contains a full interrupt vector table, and is therefore able to replace functions such as SD communication and NAND access. It uses this to load a new, expanded set of communication options, including the ability to load and execute another program at memory offset 0x800. Because it has its own interrupt vector table, it loads at offset 0, and takes control of the entire card.\n\nOnce the communications program is loaded, the programmer uses it to load more advanced programs that actually deal with the NAND flash component. Programs are loaded at offset 0x800 in order to allow the communications program (and its interrupt vector table) to stay resident.\n\nThe first program loaded is FLASH_SCAN.BIN, which is responsible for scanning the flash to determine its properties. This can be useful when operators are not familiar with the type of NAND they're working with.  This program is able to inform the host of properties such as the page size, flash size, and ECC data. The host can then use this information to construct a Card ID block.\n\nIt's important to note that the host controller can choose to ignore the information coming from the flash, and can program invalid flash sizes.  This can occur either deliberately or accidentally. Thus, some \"counterfeit\" cards may simply be a result of an operator forgetting to change the settings when programming a new batch of NAND.\n\nAfter the flash has been scanned, a program called FLASH_PRO.BIN is loaded. This is responsible for the actual programming of the NAND with the requisite firmware file. With FLASH_PRO.BIN running, the programmer must feed the card a firmware file. A wide variety of firmwares are bundled with the programming software, and vary between the vendor, page size, block size, number of planes, and the number of chip enables. The host picks an appropriate firmware file to send, and writes it out to the card.\n\nAfter programming is complete, the programmer resets the card and formats it. Depending on the size of the card, the programmer places either a FAT16 or a FAT32 header on the card, and creates the actual file allocation table. It is interesting to note that there are two DOS MBRs stored in the 2005FM.BIN programmer firmware, complete with an NTLDR boot sector. This gets placed at the head of the card, with the actual file allocation table following shortly after.\n\nThe upshot of reversing the factory programmer binaries is the development of our own routines which is capable of knocking the AX211 and loading our own code onto the device.\n\nAX211 FIRMWARE REVERSING\n\nThe contents of the programs run on the AX211 has also been analyzed. In addition to confirming the host-side initialization protocols documented above, the firmware reversing effort has revealed more details on the allocation of instruction set enhancements and the Function Specific Registers (FSRs). FSRs are memory-mapped registers that are used to control and configure the state of the hardware. For example, the pins required to turn NAND I/Os into GPIOs and toggle their values is contained in the FSR region; therefore discovering the FSR map is an important component of achieving maximum utility from the SD card controller.\n\nOpcode extensions on the 8051 are accomplished by using the escape opcode 0xA5. This is the only opcode function in the 8051 which doesn't have a pre-defined value. Typically, the escape opcode is followed by one or more bytes that specify which escape sequence to use. In our investigation of the firmware, we have only seen one and two-byte escape sequences. Two-byte sequences require that the lower nibble of the first escape opcode to be 1's. We have modified the 8051 processor module in IDA to handle these escape sequences gracefully. Our current theory is that the opcode extensions are used to trigger various NAND interface functions, such as transmitting a command cycle or computing ECC on a loaded page of memory. \n\nThe FSR map was determined in part through static binary code analysis in IDA, and in part through a dynamic fuzzing infrastructure. For example, to determine which FSR was used as a GPIO, we wrote a small assembly stub that would set a pseudo-random (based upon a seed value, so we could reproduce experiments later on) selection of four FSR registers within the 128-byte window of valid FSRs to 0xFF, then 0x00, with a few microseconds' delay between. We had connected an oscilloscope to one of the NAND I/Os on the AX211, and monitored for changes in I/O status while running this code. We decided to write four bytes at once under the theory that we had to configure not only a data register, but also direction & configuration registers as well to be outputs for us to measure a change using the oscilloscope. With some luck, we were able to discover very quickly an FSR which, when written to, would cause some of the NAND I/O pins to flip on and off.\n\nThrough this combination of static and dynamic analysis, we have confirmed the function of much of the FSR table, which looks like this: \n\n     |   0   |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7   |\n     |   8   |   9   |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |   E   |   F   |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n 80  | SDMOD |  SP   |  DPL  |  DPH  |       |       |       |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n 88  | SDOS  | SDI4  | SDI3  | SDI2  | SDI1  | SDCMD | IACK  |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n 90  | SDSM  |       |       | SDBL  | SDBH  |       | SDDL  | SDDH  |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n 98  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n A0  | NTYPE | NCMD  | NRAML | NRAMH |       |       |       |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n A8  |  IE   | NCMD1 | NCMD2 | NADD0 | NADD1 | NADD2 | NADD3 | NADD4 |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n B0  |       | RAND  |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n B8  | ER8   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n C0  | ER00  | ER01  | ER02  | ER03  |       |       |       |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n C8  | ER10  | ER11  | ER12  | ER13  |       |       |       |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n D0  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n D8  | ER20  | ER21  | ER22  | ER23  |       |       |       |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n E0  | ACC   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n E8  |       |       | NFMT  | SDDIR |       |       |       |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n F0  | B     |       | NPRE1 | NPRE2 |       |       | PORT1 |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n F8  | ER30  | ER31  | ER32  | ER33  |       |       |       |       |\n-----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\n\nOur presumption is many of the spots reading back as 00 are probably unused FSRs, so we have probably uncovered the function of most of the implemented FSRs.\n\nWORKING IT: A REPL DEBUGGER\n\nIn investigating the actual runtime firmware of the AX211 card, it has become apparent that the entire SD engine at the protocol level is implemented in 8051 code. Only the SD physical layer (including both SPI and MMC mode) is handled in hardware. When the host controller sends a command such as CMD0, the host controller actually treats the command as an offset in a jump table. Application commands are also treated in a separate jump table. This means that it is a trivial matter to add an additional command. All one needs to do is co-opt one of the unused commands, which currently point to a default handler. There is plenty of space at the end of the firmware to add any additional commands.\n\nNow that the SD controller's functions are well known, we were able to implement a REPL-mode debugger firmware for the SD controller:\n\nroot@bunnie-novena:~/ax211-code# ./ax211 -d debugger.bin\nFPGA hardware v1.26\nDebug mode APPO response [6]: {0x3f 0x00 0xc1 0x04 0x17 0xab}\nResult of factory mode: 0\n00000000 0f 41 1f 0f 0f 0f ff ff |.A......|\nExpected 0x00 0x00, got 0x0f 0x41\nLoaded debugger\nLocating fixup hooks...

Therefore, in order to implement a rich command feature set, the debugger functions are partitioned between a host CPU (the ARM i.MX6) and the target 8051-based CPU. For example, disassembling a particular region of memory breaks down to a script executed on the host side that drives the native AX211 stub code to dump the requested portion of memory to disassemble, followed up with the disassembly algorithm running on the host ARM CPU.\n\nThe only way to talk to the AX211 is via the SD interface. Therefore, the interactive REPL environment must run on the host ARM system, which is equipped with the requisite terminal interface features such as a ssh console. The REPL environment then translates the user's requests into bundles of SD commands. We take advantage of the command/response token protocol built into the SD-PHY spec (see page 8 of SD Card Physical Layer Simplified Specification v2.00 for more information). The command/response protocol runs bidirectionally on a single wire, the CMD line of the SD-PHY interface, and is timed by the CLK line. Command tokens are 48-bits long, and contain a CRC along with some static header bits. Response tokens are also 48 bits long, and similarly feature CRC protection along with different static header bits. The SD commands originating from the REPL environment are transmitted to the AX211 via the FPGA built into the host system. The FPGA presents a \u201cgpio-like\u201d API for the SD host PHY: one register for data output, one register for data input, and one register to bit-wise set the data direction. \n\nThe SD commands are received on the AX211 and processed by the hardware SD engine attached to the embedded 8051 CPU. The state machine handles receiving the data and computing/checking the CRC.  Once a complete packet is received by the state machine, the 8051 is notified of the packet's arrival via an interrupt.\n\nTherefore, the 512 bytes of native 8051 code for our debugger contains the following routines:\n\n* An entry sequence that resets the execution environment and redirects ongoing code execution into the debug.bin patch\n* An interrupt handler for receiving SD command packets\n* Code to set the ISR handler to our new interrupt handler\n* A jump table to parse incoming SD commands\n* Helper routines, such as the response transmission and wait loops\n* Implementation of all the basic stub commands:\n  * hello - inform the host we're running\n  * echo - loop back the request\n  * peek - request contents of XRAM\n  * poke - set contents of XRAM\n  * jump - run code at an address\n  * nand - manipulate the NAND hardware registers\n  * SFR/IRAM get/set routines - more on this below\n  * extended opcode - execute an extended opcode\n  * error - return an error code\n\nCROSS-MEMORY AREA ACCESS\n\nThe 8051 has two different kinds of memory, each of which is further subdivided:\n\nIRAM - located on-chip. 256 bytes in total. Accessed using \"mov\" instruction. The IRAM map is as follows:\n  * IRAM address 0-7 corresponds to CPU registers R0-R7\n  * IRAM address 8-0x7f are on-chip RAM\n  * IRAM address 0x80-0xff are Special Function Registers (SFRs). SFRs are locations that are mapped to hardware functions, such as the NAND command engine or GPIO\n\nXRAM - 16 kilobytes of \"External\" RAM (this memory was a physically separate chip in the original non-embedded 8051 implementation). Accessed by storing an address in DPTR (which is really made up of SFR 0x82 and 0x83, called DPL and DPH respectively) and either loading to the accumulator using \"movx A, @DPTR\" or storing from the accumulator using \"movx @DPTR, A\". The XRAM map is as follows:\n  * 0x0000 - 0x0006 is reserved. Contains 0x51 0x00 0x00 0x00 ...\n  * 0x0007 - 0x01ff is protected and returns 0xff. The CPU and NAND block can't read this range, but the SD block can.\n  * 0x0200 - 0x0202 is interrupt vector 0 (SPI)\n  * 0x0203 - 0x0205 is interrupt vector 1 (other SPI)\n  * 0x0206 - 0x0208 is interrupt vector 2 (NAND)\n  * 0x0209 - 0x020b is interrupt vector 3 (unknown)\n  * 0x020c - 0x02af is general-purpose RAM\n  * Code execution for APPO factory mode begins at offset 0x2900\n  * 0x2ba0 - 0x2bff contains something interesting, and I'm not sure what\n  * 0x2c00 - 0x3fff is read-only and contains zeroes\n  * 0x0000 - 0x3fff is mirrored at 0x4000, 0x8000, and 0xc000\n\nThe division of 8051 memory space into IRAM and XRAM presents a unique challenge for debugger implementation.  Not being able to index into IRAM means that one cannot dereference a variable pointer into IRAM. In the 8051 ISA, only constant values can be dereferenced into IRAM. This pseudo code draws a loose analogy of the situation in C-like syntax:\n\niram_vaule = *iram_pointer; // ERROR: variable values not allowed\niram_value = *(0x42); // ACCEPTABLE: only hard-coded constant values allowed\n\nThis limitation of the 8051 architecture present a challenge in implementing a key feature of the debugger, namely enabling the dynamic exploration of the IRAM and associated SFR space.  \n\nFortunately, on the AX211, the debugger code is loaded into XRAM, which can be indexed via the DPTR register using the MOVX instruction. This allows the debugger to manipulate its own code, thereby allowing us to change, for example, the offset constant to a MOV instruction inside the debugger.  \n\nTherefore, in order to implement peek and poke in the IRAM space (and likewise enable convenient exploration of the SFRs), we reserve three-byte slots in debug.bin using a sentinel sequence of invalid opcodes that are unique and searchable.  \n\nOnce debug.bin is loaded, one of the first tasks the host program does is scan the loaded program for the unique sequences and records their offsets. These sequences are then replaced on-demand with the appropriate instructions to implement the required MOV opcodes to explore arbitrary locations in IRAM.  \n\nBelow is a concrete example of this technique as implemented in the debugger. The following code snippet is from debugger.asm:\n\ncmd_sfr_get:\n  ; This will get replaced by \"mov 0x20, [SFR]\" at runtime\n  .db 0xa5, 0x60, 0x61\n  mov 0x21, #0\n  mov 0x22, #0\n  mov 0x23, #0\n  sjmp xmit_response\n\nHere, we are looking at the \u201cSFR get\u201d stub. The arguments to return to the host are loaded into IRAM locations 0x20-0x23. For example,\n\n  mov 0x21, #0\n\nputs the constant value 0 into IRAM 0x21; so in this stub, locations 0x21-0x23 are set to 0, and 0x20 is intended to have the value of the queried SFR. \n\nA sequence of three bytes, \u201c0xA5 0x60 0x61\u201d is used as a placeholder for a different \u201cmov\u201d instruction that will be slotted in. 0xA5 is the sole invalid opcode in the 8051 instruction set, and therefore it is an \u201calmost safe\u201d opcode (bar collisions with other opcode extensions) to use as the starting marker for a sentinel sequence. The remaining bytes \u201c0x60 0x61\u201d are simply chosen to be unique and non-colliding with other opcode extensions.  \n\nWhen the user requests the value of an SFR via the REPL interface on the host by typing, for example,\n\n  sfr -r 0xA0\n\nthe host issues a command to poke the cached location of the sentinel sequence \u201c0xA5 0x60 0x61\u201d with the sequence \u201c0x85 0x20 0xA0\u201d which represents the instruction\n\n  mov 0x20 0xA0\n\nRecall that the only difference between IRAM and SFR is that SFRs have an address greater than 0x80; and furthermore all arguments to the mov are constant, therefore this is a valid 8051 instruction that implements the requested command via the REPL interface.  \n\nNow that the correct instruction has been installed in the cmd_sfr_get routine, the actual command to run this callback is issued on the SD interface and the requested SFR is returned to the host. This enhanced ability to interrogate the SFR space dynamically allowed us to greatly expand our map of the special function registers.\n\nEXTENDED OPCODES\n\nA similar method was used to also explore the extended opcode space for the 8051. As noted in the previous section, \u201c0xA5\u201d is the sole illegal instruction in the native 8051 instruction set, and in enhancements such as the one found in the AX211, it is used as an escape sequence to specify an extended instruction set.  \n\nAs a (entertaining) side-note, the sparse literature available on the AX211 claims that the on-board 8051 is a 32-bit processor. We originally thought this was an amusing \u201clost in translation\u201d moment, but in fact, the AX211 implements a set of instructions that operate on 32-bit data types using extended opcodes, thereby lending credibility to the \u201c32-bit\u201d label.  \n\nSFR locations 0xC0-3, 0xC8-B, 0xD8-B, and 0xF8-B were identified as functioning 32-bit registers, and opcodes were discovered that could reverse the order of bits in these registers, invert the contents of these registers, and clear the contents of these registers to zero. There may be other opcodes present as well; code has been found implementing CRC16 checksums using these 32-bit enhancements, and most likely these enhancements also enable the implementation of MLC/TLC scrambling algorithms. The BCH ECC computations, however, are handled by a dedicated hardware coprocessor.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAn approach has been disclosed for the exploration and exploitation of the embedded controller found within a particular type of SD card. The approach consists of a combination of static code analysis, and dynamic fuzzing analysis. A \"secret knock\" for uploading code into the controller was found, and through this mechanism we explored the register map and extended opcodes of the microcontroller. Significantly, in this particular device all of the SD protocol-layer commands are implemented in software. This allowed us to redefine the SD protocol set and implement, as a demonstration, a REPL-mode debugger for the SD card.",

This is a high water mark in civilisation. Since then, at least in the west, we have enjoyed an unprecedented degree of freedom and prosperity. In the subsequent decades further victories were won around equal rights on issues of race, gender, or sexuality. By the 1990s peace appeared to be breaking out around the world, the Cold War was over, and we all lived in an increasingly connected, globalised village. Or did we....\n\nPresident Eisenhower coined the phrase \"the military-industrial complex\". He recognised that conflict was good for business, and this had implications for future security. He was prescient. After the racial war was won in the USA, they announced the \"war on drugs\" which has disproportionately hit ethnic communities in America; as the Soviet threat receded, so the Islamist threat came to prominence; and as the free flow of information spread over the internet, so the fight-back began with the copyright wars, surveillance, and the crackdown on whistleblowers and organisations such as Wikileaks.

It's also common for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to use exploits and malware to infect and monitor computers, mobile devices and to spy on networks. They're able to bug our rooms with our own telephones, read encrypted emails, log keystrokes - they invade the most personal spaces in the very core of a person's life with minimal economic impact to their budget.\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss the nature of targeted and untargeted surveillance, exploitation and intelligence gathering. This active surveillance is produced and operated not only by governments but by corporations and mercenaries that provide their intrusion services to the highest bidders who often have the lowest respect for human rights.\n\nWe'll introduce you to the players in the business of active, passive, tactical and strategic surveillance and the products they provide. We'll also discuss examples of specific attacks on journalists and human rights activists worldwide in the last couple of years. Surprises won't be missing.",

Communications hegemony is impossible without the obedience of the people who build and run the system.\n\nOur network has become the nervous system of the world. \nWe must wake up to this. We must realize the power and responsibility we hold for the great structural problems of our time. This year, Edward Snowden showed that we are not powerless.

        "description": "In the past two years both the US Government as well as the European Commission have declared their intend to create \u201cIdentity Ecosystems\u201d and are actively pursuing the creation of regulatory and technical frameworks for digital authentication of their citizens. Both the USA and the European Union expect the implementation of state-recognized digital identities in the coming three to five years.\n\nThe American initiative is called \u201cNational Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), its European counterpart \u201celectronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market\u201c (COM(2012) 238). \n\nGiven the scope of these programs, the number of people affected and the fact that identity technologies necessarily have to negotiate conflicting values of individual liberty and social control, it is reasonable to expect that the developments around NSTIC and COM (2012) 238 will become dominant in the debate on the future of the Internet.\n\nIn my talk I will introduce the basics of the White Houses NSTIC initiative and the European Unions COM(2012) 238, explaining the common traits as well as the conflicting aspects of the electronic identity programs of two of the worlds largest and most influential  state entities. \n\nI will outline how both programs share the assumption that providing \u201csecure\u201d and \u201ctrusted\u201d identities is essential for the future development of the Internet, is necessary to fully realize citizenship status on the Net as well as to foster further economic growth. I will also scrutinize the importance and function of the term \u201ctransaction\u201d that is prominent in both NSTIC and COM (2012) 238.\n\nSubsequently I will show that NSTIC and COM (2012) 238 differ fundamentally in their view on the role of the state, of the private sector and of civil society in providing and controlling the standards, protocols and infrastructures of digital identities. Here I will outline how the NSTIC employs a neoliberal market rhetoric, declaring that \u201cthe Identity Ecosystem should be market- driven\u201c while the European Union follows an etaistic vision of governmental identity provision. In this context I will show the importance of the different approaches between Europe and the USA concerning the relation of existing offline and online identity solutions.\n\nThe goal of the talk is to raise awareness to the importance of these programs, to enable an understanding of the paradoxes of digital identity provision and its function in both enabling and sustaining statehood and capitalism. The talk will close with a statement locating the differences between the European and the United States approach in the larger conflict on the question of means and legitimacy of intervening and regulating capitalism.\n\nDuration 40 mins + 20 min discussion, presentation style will be slides and accompanying talk, discussion afterwards.\n",

White-box implementations of the AES and DES ciphers were presented, but they were all badly broken. Subsequent attempts were no better. Whereas some theoretical foundations of white-box cryptography have been given recently in Wyseur's PhD thesis, so far they have not lead to any practical scheme.\n\nI present an overview of the white-box cryptography concept along with the most common applications and proposed designs.

        "abstract": "In this work we present a stealthy malware that exploits dedicated hardware on the target system and remains persistant across boot cycles. The malware is capable of gathering valuable information such as passwords. Because the infected hardware can perform arbitrary main memory accesses, the malware can modify kernel data structures and escalate privileges of processes executed on the system.\n\nThe malware itself is a DMA malware implementation referred to as DAGGER. DAGGER exploits Intel\u2019s Manageability Engine (ME), that executes firmware code such as Intel\u2019s Active Management Technology (iAMT), as well as its OOB network channel. We have recently improved DAGGER\u2019s capabilites to include support for 64-bit operating systems and a stealthy update mechanism to download new attack code.",
        "description": "Dedicated hardware such as network interface cards and video controllers can be exploited to conduct a direct memory access (DMA) attack. Direct access means main memory access without the involvement of the host CPU, which in turn means that existing host security software cannot detect or prevent the attack.\n\nOur presentation covers a DMA malware that benefits from an isolated network channel to update the attack code and to exfiltrate captured data. To be more precise, we show how to conduct a DMA attack using Intel's Manageability Engine (ME). Our attack environment is dedicated hardware based on a 32-bit RISC processor called ARCtangent-A4 (ARC4, x86-incompatible) implemented in the chipset of modern Intel platforms. Intel's ME executes special firmware such as Intel's Active Management Technology (iAMT). The ME/iAMT environment provides an administrator with an Out-of-Band (OOB) network channel to maintain the computer platform remotely. A prominent iAMT feature is the capability to remotely reinstall an operating system that got corrupted and does not boot anymore. iAMT is also available when the platform is in a standby or powered off state. This can be exploited to implement persistent DMA malware. It is needless to say that such a powerful environment must be well protected. Hence, Intel enforces strong isolation of the ME execution environment that makes it perfect to hide malware. The ME is not only implemented in business platforms, but also in consumer platforms.\n\nOur work does not only show, that an arbitrary attacker is able to perform one of the most dangerous attacks against an iAMT featured platform, but also, that the ME provides a perfect environment for undetectable sensitive data leakage on behalf of the attacker. Our presentation consists of three parts. The first part addresses how to find valuable data in the main memory of the host. The second part exploits the ME's OOB network channel to exfiltrate captured data to an external platform and to inject new attack code to target other interesting data structures available in the host runtime memory. The last part deals with the implementation of a covert network channel based on JitterBug.\n\nIn the first part of our presentation we exploit the DMA engine of Intel's ME to find valuable data in the host runtime memory. We have two memory targets. Our first target is the keyboard buffer. We demonstrate how to find the buffer on a Linux as well as on a Windows operating system. Our implementation is called DAGGER - DmA based keyloGGER. We implemented different search strategies for the operating system targets. On Windows we need to find the corresponding CR3 processor register value to get the page directory entries that are needed to map virtual memory addresses into physical ones. We also had to take address randomization into account. The search strategy for the Windows keyboard buffer is mainly based on finding and traversing the so called Object Manager Namespace Directory (OMND). On Linux we implemented a different search strategy. On Linux we have a different starting point for the search phase than on Windows. The implementation to map virtual memory addresses into physical ones is also different. On Linux we can go without page tables. Due to the availability of the Linux source code it was easier to derive a signature for our target structure used by the USB HID driver. \n\nWe can permanently monitor the keyboard buffer on both operating system targets. Hence, we can capture all user input (passwords, instant messenger sessions, etc.) done via the associated keyboard. Our second memory target concerns the privilege data of an arbitrary process. Again, we use the DMA engine of the ME to find the appropriate data structure. Then we overwrite the existing privileges with root privileges via DMA.\n\nThe privilege escalation attack actually belongs to the second part of our attack scenario. The implementation is based on an updated version of DAGGER that is able to attack 64-bit operation systems. We demonstrate how to remotely load new attack code (to escalate privileges) to be executed on Intel's ME using the isolated OOB channel. To figure out how to exploit the DMA engine to read from the host runtime memory was comparatively easy due to previous work. To figure out how to exploit the ME OOB feature was more challenging. We had to find the ring buffers that iAMT uses to send and receive network packets and the corresponding ring buffer pointers. We also had to find code that is responsible for sending data to an external platform in the 16MB iAMT firmware runtime memory. To get the OOB channel under our control we implemented a breakpoint helper tool. That tool disassembles and displays iAMT code present in the iAMT runtime memory on-the-fly. This enables us to set breakpoints (based on hooks) to check the register content of the ARC4 processor. We were able to identify all necessary OOB channel parts by setting breakpoints and by triggering network events.\n\nThe last part of our presentation deals with a covert network channel based on JitterBug. The OOB channel is perfect to hide malicious network packets from the host, but not from other monitors present in the network. The aim of the JitterBug based covert network channel is to demonstrate how far an attacker can go with stealthy data exfiltration when using Intel's ME as attack environment. Using the JitterBug technique the attacker exfiltrates information by introducing seemingly random delays to some outgoing network packets. The delay pattern can be decoded by an external platform that is under the control of the attacker. Since timing is very important to implement a JitterBug, we had to figure out how to exactly measure time in the ME execution environment. Furthermore, we had to determine which network packets are \"delayable\" and how to delay them. To learn how to use the required ME/iAMT components for a JitterBug implementation we developed a more advanced debug tool. This debug tool is based on ARC4 code emulation and it enabled us to collect a huge amount of firmware trace logs that eventually revealed the required parts of the ME/iAMT inner workings. \n\nIn our talk we will present important runtime memory areas and ARC4 disassemblies of the ARC4 based code. Furthermore, we will present demo videos of our attack scenarios. Please note, we do not present a new security vulnerability to exploit Intel's ME.",

W\u00e4hrend die letzteren ein hohes Abh\u00e4ngigkeitspotenzial aufweisen und sowohl dem Konsumenten als auch seiner Umgebung erheblichen Schaden zuf\u00fcgen, steht dem im Falle von Psychedelika die M\u00f6glichkeit der Ausl\u00f6sung psychotischer Zust\u00e4nde sowie (bei bestimmten Substanzen) eine m\u00f6gliche Neurotoxizit\u00e4t gegen\u00fcber. Die jahrtausendelange Tradition des therapeutischen und rekreationalen Gebrauchs von psychedelischen Pflanzen (und Tieren) wird dagegen im modernen \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d ausgeblendet. Wie die Ergebnisse der psychedelischen Forschung der 50er/60er Jahre und der seltenen akademischen Studien heute zeigen, sind Substanzen wie LSD, Psilocybin, MDMA und Ketamin potentiell m\u00e4chtige Werkzeuge, um an der menschlichen Psyche nachhaltige \u00c4nderungen vorzunehmen.\n                          \nIn diesem Vortrag wird der Versuch unternommen, aus einer m\u00f6glichst neutralen Position heraus \u00fcber einige Psychedelika zu sprechen. Nach einer kurzen systematischen Zusammenfassung gehen wir auf die Wirkungsmechanismen ein und erkl\u00e4ren die Zusammenh\u00e4nge zwischen ihrer Pharmakodynamik und der beabsichtigten therapeutischen/rekreationalen Wirkung. Es werden beispielhafte Sessionabl\u00e4ufe geschildert (wie sie in den gegenw\u00e4rtigen klinischen Studien stattfinden) und m\u00f6gliche langfristige Sch\u00e4den sowie unerw\u00fcnschte Nebenwirkungen erl\u00e4utert.  \n                          \nDer Vortrag ist keineswegs als ein Pl\u00e4doyer f\u00fcr den Gebrauch illegaler Substanzen zu verstehen; Ziel ist vielmehr die Vermittlung des f\u00fcr einen bewussten und verantwortungsvollen Umgang mit Psychedelika notwendigen Wissens.",

This lecture will shed light on India's surveillance industry, its UID scheme which aims at the collection of all biometric data and on various controversial surveillance schemes, such as the Central Monitoring System (CMS).  ",
        "description": "When it comes to surveillance, the most mainstream argument is that the majority of India's population lives below the poverty line and that surveillance is an elitist issue - and not a \"real\" issue which affects the masses. \n\nGiven that the majority of India's population has mobile phones and that the Indian government is currently implementing the Central Monitoring System (CMS) which aims at intercepting all telecommunications (and Internet communications), surveillance does not appear to be an elitist issue. Given that the UID scheme aims at collecting the biometric data of all citizens residing in India and that most BPL cash programmes require UID registration, surveillance appears to be an issue which (unfortunately) affects the 1.2 billion people currently living in India. And this is to say the least.\n\nAs part of the Privacy Project, the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS) in Bangalore, India, is investigating surveillance within the country. The project is funded by Privacy International and aims to map out various forms of surveillance in India, ranging from drones, CCTV cameras and GPS tracking equipment to phone and Internet monitoring gear. \n\nThis lecture aims to present the research that Maria Xynou has undertaken at the CIS so far, which includes data on the various surveillance technology companies operating in India and the type of spy gear they sell to Indian law enforcement agencies. This research also includes the presentation of India's various controversial surveillance schemes, with an emphasis on the Central Monitoring System (CMS) which unlawfully enables the interception of all telecommunications and Internet communications. \n\nIndia is currently implementing the world's largest biometric data collection and interception of communications schemes. The aim of this lecture is to present India's scary mass surveillance and to discuss its implications on the right to privacy and other human rights. ",

        "description": "The internet is destroying the business of news. Not only does the web make it harder to sell advertising on dead trees, it also changes what it means to investigate and tell a good news story. Scoops aren't just researched on the phone anymore, but in scraped databases or leaked data dumps. Yet most journalists are missing the skills to access such information effectively. This means two things: we need training for journos and collaborations between hacks and hackers.\n\nSome news organisations are waking up to this fact: the New York Times has an interactive team that employs some of the best web developers, and the non-profit ProPublica has its own nerd team working as data-driven reporters. Working in a news organisation requires coders to change the way they do things and to focus on telling a good story, rather than building a beautiful application.\n\nAfter coding on open data applications for a few years, I applied to join OpenNews and to try and build data-driven news applications from inside a news organisation. After a year at Spiegel Online and visiting news orgs around the world, I've explored not just the weird space of online news, but also the kinds of systems that we need to build to enable journalists to run their investigations deeper, and to keep track of the knowledge they collect.",

        "abstract": "A year ago in November 2012, Nintendo released their latest home video game console: the Wii U. While most video game consoles use controllers that are very basic, the Wii U took the opposite route with a very featureful gamepad: wireless with a fairly high range, touch screen, speakers, accelerometer, video camera, and even NFC are supported by the Wii U gamepad. However, as of today, this interesting piece of hardware can only be used in conjunction with a Wii U: wireless communications are encrypted and obfuscated, and there is no documentation about the protocols used for data exchange between the console and its controller. Around december 2012, I started working with two other hackers in order to reverse engineer, document and implement the Wii U gamepad communication protocols on a PC. This talk will present our findings and show the current state of our reverse engineering efforts.",
        "description": "When the Wii U was released, a few console hackers and I were talking about potential uses for the Wii U gamepad. However, before being able to use a Wii U gamepad as a remote controller for a robot or a quadricopter, the first step was to understand how it worked and how to communicate with it. This started our long journey of soldering wires on Flash chips, reading the h.264 specification and complaining about the lack of features in most Wi-Fi drivers and devices (on all platforms, Linux and ath9k devices being the least horrible).\n\nWhile some \u201cjournalists\u201d reported that the Wii U gamepad is using the Miracast\u2122 technology, a Wi-Fi standard, it turned out that this was never the case. Instead, Nintendo decided to reinvent four different protocols (video streaming, audio streaming, input streaming as well as a light request-reply RPC protocol), and embed them in a slightly obfuscated version of WPA2, sent over the air using 5GHz Wi-Fi 802.11n. A small ARM CPU is embedded in the Wii U Gamepad (codenamed DRC) and runs a realtime operating system to handle network communication. In the Wii U, another ARM CPU (codenamed DRH) does the same thing.\n\nIn this presentation, we will go into the details of how we went from a 32MB binary blob to a proof of concept of Wii U gamepad \u201cemulation\u201d on a PC, including full documentation of the wireless communications obfuscation layer and partial documentation of the four data exchange protocols used on the gamepad.",

In 2010, he called for the swarming of the concepts behind FDN. The idea was to copy locally what FDN was doing at a country scale and spread the word about self-hosting, Net neutrality and the stakes for society.\n\nThe call was followed by the creation of several non-profit organizations, quickly federated in a meta-structure called FFDN, for Federation FDN.\n\n2 years later, FFDN is much bigger. From 7 orgs, there are now 21, counting around 1 400 members.\nA human network above the machine's one.\n\nFrom the beginning, we knew that we were not alone and in the meantime we met with similar organizations around the world, like the Free Network Fundation in the USA or Guifi in Spain.\nWe launched an international mailing list to spread the recipes for building open and neutral access to the Internet in many situations. During OHM, this talk helped federating energies around a belgium project and we hope 30C3 will be the occasion to spread the word even more, maybe to give some ideas and plant some seeds for building a better Internet.\n\nAfter all, Y U NO TRY ?\n\n",

Bad use of GPS and internet protocol to apply fees.\nII. Correct use of OTP sector in ULTRALIGHT chips.\nIII. Correct data stamping on tickets.\n\n\nIn the second part we will show a proof of concept of a validation machine which uses a secure way to validate tickets. The machine is based on an Arduino Uno device, and we're going to use MIFARE ULTRALIGHT as kind of NFC chips to keep the whole solution low cost.\n\nAll source code will be made available as opensource just after the talk to let everyone use it to create secure solutions in the world.",

        "description": "<h3> Common project structure used in the product industry </h3>\n\n<p> The concept of Product Lifecycle Management is the process of managing the entire lifecycle of a product from its conception, through design and manufacture, to service and disposal. PLM is about how to handle versions, communication with users, etc. Every PLM has to be tailor made to the project and the team working on it. PLM is vital to organize open hardware projects to be more focused and efficient, yet being open and adaptive at the same time. Building a PLM is time demanding but will make your projects more and more efficient. </p>\n\n<h3> Our experiences so far </h3>\n\n<p> Our project is the i3 Berlin 3D printer, a remix of the Prusa i3. \n- It is an electromechanical project that is mainly built from printed parts and standardized sourced parts.\n- We don\u00b4t develop electronics, but we do design mechanical parts and make adjustments to the firmware.\n- We also sell our design as a kit, which need a manual and a bill of materials that is always up to date. - Furthermore we have to track issues and we want to be open for cooperation by other people. </p>\n\n<p> We used Blender to design the entire machine. \n- Blender is a 3D mesh modeler, where the industry uses solely parametric CAD software when it comes to electromechanical engineering.\n- Parametric 3D models are smart, where mesh models are stupid models you modify with smart tools. \n- Mesh modeling is a very suitable method, when 3D printing is the main manufacturing method. Design files are much easier to share among people and programs.\n- Cables are an intricate part of a moving machine which can be modeled well within Blender. \n- We wrote a plug in to generate a bill of material and developed a method to make a step by step visual manual with animation frames. Both BOM and manual are a part of the design file and therefore these will always be up to date. The rendered pictures from Blenders </p>\n\n<p> For communication we use Github. \n- The core ideas and design requirements grow over time in the wiki. \n- The submit structure of Github automatically takes care for a version control.\n- Git issues work as a support ticket system to track and solve problems. \n- Design guidelines make sure that everyone cooperating organizes their work coherently with the project. </p>\n\n<h3> Future plans </h3>\n\n<p> - make Blender more accessible by making tutorials directly focused on mechanical design. \n- connect the BOM with a database for logistics and price calculations and demand estimation,\n  supply chain\n- continue work on OHM (open hardware management) toolbox </p>\n",

Because computers basically do the same thing, it's not too absurd to try to link these two together. The result is a brain-computer-interface.\nThis talk explains the core functionality of our brain and how to access the stored data from the outside. Software and hardware have already reached a somewhat hacker-friendly state, and we want to show you how we got there. We're also here to answer all your questions about the brain.",
        "description": "Communication between humans and computers has great tradition, but also underlies several disadvantages. Interfaces like mice, keyboards or microphones essentially link the user's body parts to a computer. When creating new content, these interfaces prove to be relatively inefficient, inaccurate and limited by the user's skill.\nA good brain-computer-interface would take body movements out of the process. Less required skill and more information flow density are only the most obvious benefits. It is a potential replacement for dozens of today's specialized devices. And, just as a microphone does for voice, it would also allow the transfer of visual imaginations.\n\nBefore we explain how to create the most advanced brain-computer-interface possible today, Dominic dives quite deeply into the signal processing structure in the brain. He presents the most recent findings in cognitive science and explains what happens - step for step - when we imagine the image of a red ball. At the end of this first section, he arrives at the level of electrical signals.\n\nAnne then takes over with the groundwork necessary to capture and process these electrical signals. She isn't afraid to use proper math for a deeper understanding, but she made sure that her talk is easy to follow for non-tech majors too. The foundation for a contemporary brain-computer-interface consists of several core algorithms, which are used in lab settings today and by enthusiasts tomorrow. She calls out the pitfalls when dealing with signals from live brains, and covers the technical limitations with crunching the data.\n\nWe finish with a real-world perspective. The power of today's available hardware and software is still limited, but our understanding of informations inside and outside the brain has improved drastically. We've come a long way since electrode-level pattern matching, and we'd be excited to show you some examples of what's possible today.",

These problems are here to stay as low-level languages like C or C++ continue to trade safety for potential performance. A small set of all proposed solutions (e.g., Address Space Layout Randomization, Data Execution Prevention, and stack canaries) is applied in practice but real exploits show that all currently deployed protections can be defeated. \n\nIn this talk we systematize the existing knowledge about (i) attack vectors and specific techniques to exploit running software and (ii) defense mechanisms that protect against the attack vectors. Many of these techniques have been developed hand in hand. We take a methodological approach and cover the complete design space for control-flow based and data-flow based attacks for low-level languages.\n\nThe problems of current protection mechanisms calls for novel approaches towards software protection that adhere to the three laws of software defenses: low overhead for high security guarantees, no changes to the original source code, and compatibility to existing libraries and binaries (including a partial migration strategy).",

        "subtitle": "Physically Unclonable Functions for Hardware Tamper Detection",
        "abstract": " \tIncreasingly, users and their computing hardware are exposed a range of software and hardware attacks, ranging from disk imaging to hardware keylogger installation and beyond. Existing methods are inadequate to fully protect users, particularly from covert physical hardware modifications in the \"evil maid\" scenario, and yet are very inconvenient. Victims include governments and corporations traveling internationally (e.g. China), anti-government activists in places like Syria, and anyone who is a target of a motivated attacker who can gain physical access.\n\nPhysically Unclonable Functions, combined with a trusted mobile device and a network service, can be used to mitigate these risks. We present a novel open-source mobile client and network service which can protect arbitrary hardware from many forms of covert modification and attack, and which when integrated with software, firmware, and policy defenses, can provide greater protection to users and limit potential attack surface. We'll also be showing video of an unreleased tool to the public utilized by surveillance teams.",
        "description": "Additional Notes for our talk:\n\n1) The attack addressed is an entire class of hardware, firmware, and software attacks around the attacker gaining surreptitious access and modification (of hardware/firmware/software) on one or more occasions, followed by the authorized user making normal use of the device after these modifications.\n\nA software-only attack can be addressed through \"trusted boot\" or \"measured boot\" systems (e.g. what TCG does). Firmware attacks are generally not addressed by most measured boot processes, but that's just an implementation problem. The most novel category of attack is defeating the addition of hardware components or modification of hardware components, which becomes a desirable attack once software/firmware are locked down.\n\nOne scenario is that an investor flies to China with a laptop and a cellphone and intends to remain in the country for several weeks, conducting business online as well as in person. On several occasions, the investor leaves his laptop in his hotel room, while taking his cellphone with him at all times. Adversary agents, as hotel staff, enter the room and make modifications to hardware, with the intent of circumventing either local software protections (cloning drives, capturing pass phrases, etc.) or subverting network resources later accessed, either while the investor remains in China or after he returns to the home office with the laptop.\n\nIn-depth physical analysis of the hardware, conducted at home base, can often discover hardware modifications. Best current practice is to quarantine \"travel\" machines and never allow them back on high security networks. Unfortunately, this leaves the user exposed for the entire duration of a single trip -- in some situations the entire transaction happens during a trip, so all sensitive information must be protected for that trip.\n\nPUFs and our network verification can be used to effectively \"sign\" hardware in the field in a way which can be automatically verified and verified interactively with a \"home base\" network service. This lets network resources be protected continuously; before every access, the client device's integrity can be checked and attested.\n\nAn interesting strategy is to not travel with any sensitive hardware (beyond the cellphone) and buy random laptops at the destination, enroll them in the service while at the destination, provision them with services, and ensure no subsequent unauthorized hardware/firmware/software changes can be made, using the same system.\n\n2) PUFs\n\nThe PUFs are functions which can't be (tractably) cloned. Unfortunately, virtually none of these can be inspected/verified/attested directly by an unaided human -- anything which is a simple serial number seal or other human-verifiable thing can be fairly trivially counterfeited.\n\nThe PUFs make use of large amounts of random and changing data, created through physically random processes which are impossible to (tractably) reproduce. The innovation is to use a user's cellphone and a network service as the verifier -- the phone can remain in the user's physical custody at all times, and by splitting the verification between the phone (on site with the user) and a network service acting as gatekeeper to protected network resources, the system can be protected from various attacks.\n\nThe PUFS that we take advatage of are that of the physical systems themselves. When a device is created during manufacture a multitude of processes are utilized to produce the compute device. As it turns out reproducibility on the sub millimetre scale of a identical compenents such as a laptop case is excessively difficult to clone/counterfit/interact with without disturbing the previous state. We take advantage of these flaws to aid the user in detecting modification to their computing devices through photography and other standard low cost tamper evidencing devices which a untrained user can deploy in the field.\n\nClear technical documentation w/ photos explaining why it is incredibly difficult with current attack methods to perfectly clone manufactured parts which on the surface are indistinguishable from another manufactured assembly.",

The \"world's largest democracy\" strongly leaning towards becoming a surveillance state raises many questions and poses severe challenges for free speech and economic justice in India and globally. This talk will map and review the current political, socio-cultural and legal landscape of mass-surveillance, data protection and censorship in India and analyse how it ties in to the global landscape of surveillance and censorship.

These include the world\u2019s largest biometric ID scheme (Aadhaar/UID), the Central Monitoring System(CMS), the Telephone Call Interception System (TCIS), a DNA data bank and the  National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID).\n\nThe  \"world's largest democracy\" strongly leaning towards becoming a surveillance state raises many questions and poses severe challenges for free speech and economic justice, not just in India but globally.\n\nThis talk will map and review the current political, socio-cultural and legal landscape of mass-surveillance, data protection and censorship in India and analyse how it ties in to the global landscape of surveillance and censorship.

But how do we do it? This talk will outline a framework for a user-focused approach to the Development and Impact of Internet Freedom Tools through using ethnography, human-centered design, and the practice of research-based product definition. This talk is intended for developers, researchers, and journalists who seek to understand how better tools can be developed to protect anonymity and provide unfettered access to the Internet.",
        "description": "Internet Freedom Tools (IFTs) are developed to solve the technical challenges of anonymity, privacy, security and information access. Focus on these technical challenges rather than the user of an IFT can lead to overlooking the motivations, needs and usability issues faced by user communities. Further, IFTs may solve a technical challenge for users, and yet fall short when it comes to user experience. There is a disconnect that must be remedied for IFTs and the people who use them to realize their full potential. This talk seeks to provide new insights to developers and users in need of knowledge on how they can better address relevant problems, create appropriate solutions and help users with IFTs.\n\nThis talk will explain to the audience what tools are available for user-focused design. It will also walk through a framework to guide the development of IFTs that is grounded in ethnographic methods and human-centered design, and how this framework is being used to conduct an IFT user community.\n\nThis work is currently being conducted by SecondMuse and Radio Free Asia through the Open Technology Fund (www.opentechfund.org).\n\nADDENDUM: But, what is \"Ethnography\"? What are \"User Communities\"?\n\nEthnography is defined as the study of culture and human motivation through qualitative research. Ethnographic practices complement usability studies by tapping into needs and motivations of people and users to give the \"why\" behind certain actions observed solely through conducting usability research. This method includes interviews, observing specific behaviors and understanding the material culture and surrounds of a target group. \n\nA community is defined as a group of users that can be defined by geography, culture, shared experiences, or shared challenges. User is defined as someone who is currently utilizing a particular IFTs such as Tor, RedPhone, CryptoCat, and/or other privacy, security, anonymity and access enhancing technologies and methodologies created by developers or users themselves. A user may also be defined as a potential user of such technologies and tools.",

The first part of our talk deals with security issues of HomeMatic devices and their wireless communication protocol called BidCoS (Bidirectional Communication Standard). In the second part we introduce Homegear, our own interface software to control HomeMatic devices.",
        "description": "In the past few years wireless home automation systems have become increasingly available as a good alternative to wired systems. Since wireless devices are installable without ripping open walls, it is now possible to easily integrate them into an existing building infrastructure. We chose to work with HomeMatic, because we think that through its affordable prices, its good quality and its fast growing portfolio it will become the most widely spread wireless home automation system in Germany.\nIn this live hacking presentation we will introduce different mechanisms to attack a HomeMatic system. We will show how to sniff BidCoS packets, how to send arbitrary packets in order to emulate a device (e. g. a HomeMatic central) and to control devices.\nSome devices use an AES handshake to verify the sender of a command. But not all devices support the handshake and for many devices it is disabled by default. We will demonstrate several attacks making use of this security issue.\nAfter the live hacking part we will give a short introduction into Homegear. Homegear is an interface software, which directly communicates with BidCoS devices and is controllable through XML RPC (XML Remote Procedure Call). It is possible to fully control most HomeMatic devices. We developed it to add features which are not integrated into the official system like controlling valve drives directly to implement custom room temperature control algorithms.",

Can hacking provide an alternative approach to technology which can overcome this? How do art and beauty fit into this approach?",
        "description": "In order to understand the essence of hacking, it is important to first critically examine the essence of (modern) technology and the rationalization of technological development.\nBecause for all the wonderful things technology has given us, it has also brought us a vast array of instruments for domination, ranging from nuclear warheads to the panoptic surveillance state. As a community that is so deeply involved with technology, it is imperative for us to comprehend that these developments did not come out of thin air and that we have the choice to follow a different path.\nUnderstanding Heideggers notion of enframing as the product of historical rationalization gives us an insight in the relation between the objective, scientific approach to technology and its instrumentalization as a means for domination.\nYet it also highlights the subversive potential of hacker cultures. The hackers' playful curiosity and desire to express creativity within the computer-imposed frameworks of formal logic has the potential to transcend code into poetry, reconnecting techne with poiesis and mapping the road towards the revealing nature of technology. Hacking has the potential to elevate abstract technological mechanisms and relations dissociated from the individuality to the plane of the utmost concrete and subjective images. As the creative output of the hacker both adheres to the formal methods of boolean logic and at the same time challenges them by devoiding them of their rational finalities, the positivist rationale of what we hold to be most objective can be turned into an expression of the subject. I will argue that this repositioning of the subject provides the basis for transforming the technological rationale into one that is aimed at liberation.\n",

At the same time, it shall provide information about Amnesty International's positions and activities in this field and invite anybody interested in our work to get involved.",
        "description": "In the past 20 years, digital technologies have become widely used in data processing and transmission. This phenomenon, often labelled as \u201edigital revolution\u201c, has brought about great improvements in efficiency in the daily lives of many and for society as a whole.\n\nThe fight for a better protection of human rights has also benefitted vastly from these developments: It is hard to imagine that the \u201eArab Spring\u201c movement could have gained the same momentum without the widespread use of modern information and communications media. Classified documents (the leaks by Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden only being the most spectactular ones) bearing witness, for the first time, to human rights violations of a number of states, wouldn't have seen the same spread and publicity without anonymous online whistleblower platforms like WikiLeaks. Today, numerous projects interconnect human rights defenders all around the world through blogs, social networks, short messaging services and smartphone apps. As networks and bandwidths evolve, these technologies more and more enable activists in all parts of the world to compare notes on a global basis, exchange information and experiences, upload evidence of human rights violations and protect themselves more effectively.\n\nOn the other hand, governments also use these technologies to spy on, track down and detain people that they believe could jeopardise their power. In many cases, these measures affect people who have merely exercised their human rights. States use their capabilities to oppress actions or opinions they do not deem suitable. They covertly eavesdrop on electronic communications on a large scale, thus undermining the anonymity of communication and the privacy of people. They block content or services on the Internet, break into private email accounts, censor opinions through gigantic word filters, or even shut down communications networks in times of civil unrest and political protests.\n\nThe revelations of the last months concerning the NSA's and GCHQ's surveillance activities by far exceed the dimensions of global communications interception known to the public so far. At the same time, whistleblowers disclosing classified information about human rights violations face severe persecution by State authorities. The EU Directive on blanket telecommunications data retention and dubious EU research projects like INDECT add to the evolving picture that it is not just states with a well-known record of extensive communications interception, filtering and censoring like China, Iran or Saudi Arabia, that seem to attach little value to human rights in digital networks.\n\nThese are but a few examples of the ambivalent impact of digitisation on human rights. While modern information and communications technologies have yielded new opportunities for individuals to exercise their rights, they have also given rise to new ways for governments to prevent, obstruct or control these activities effectively. Current developments show that the excessive use of government power in this environment imperils the full enjoyment of human rights, in particular the right to privacy and the freedom of expression and information. In fact, governments all over the world these days seem to engage in what could be described as a repressive backlash against the facilitations that modern information and communications technologies have brought about for the exercise of human rights.\n\nAmnesty International's German section is currently setting up a new task force (preliminarily known as Digital@Amnesty) that focuses on human rights violations in the context of the use of digital information and communications technology. Our mission is to keep a critical eye on the further development of these technologies and to assist in finding a position on the issues arising thereof with a view to the future protection of human rights in a digital environment.\n\nThis talk will present some aspects of our work, the position Amnesty takes on recent incidents in this field (including a legal assessment from a human rights perspective), and ways to get involved.",

        "abstract": "Die alarmierenden Zust\u00e4nde beim Abbau der Rohstoffe, die in den Bauteilen (z. B. dem Tantal-Elektrolytkondensator) eines Computers stecken, rufen Menschenrechtler auf den Plan. In den U.S.A. ist es 2010 gelungen, ein umstrittenes Gesetz umzusetzen, das die Finanzierung von Kriegsparteien durch Erzhandel regulieren soll. In der EU soll nun \u00e4hnliches geschehen. Der Vortrag kl\u00e4rt \u00fcber die Geschichte auf, nennt Konsequenzen und formuliert Forderungen. \n",
        "description": "\"Dead Tree Edition\" wird auf ironische Weise Ausgedrucktes genannt, das auch elektronisch verf\u00fcgbar ist. Man ignoriert dabei, dass f\u00fcr die Online-Infrastruktur und all die Computer nicht nur B\u00e4ume, sondern gleich ganze Berge, auf denen sie gestanden haben, abgetragen werden. Und Menschen kommen auch zu Schaden.\n\nUm die Jahrtausendwende hat die UN aufgedeckt, dass der Handel mit Metallerzen, wie sie zur Herstellung von Elektronikbauteilen benutzt werden, die Konfliktparteien in der D.R. Kongo finanziert und somit den B\u00fcrgerkrieg am Leben erh\u00e4lt. Der Begriff der \"Konfliktmineralien\" wurde geboren. \n\nZehn Jahre sp\u00e4ter hat ein engagiertes B\u00fcndnis von Nichtregierungsorganisationen eine Regelung in ein US-amerikanisches B\u00f6rsengesetz (Dodd-Frank-Act) einbringen k\u00f6nnen, das die Hersteller verpflichtet, den Kauf gewisser Rohstoffe aus dem Kongo zu ver\u00f6ffentlichen. Die Folgen waren zun\u00e4chst verheerend, sp\u00e4ter zukunftsweisend. Konfliktfreie Mineralien aus dem Gebiet sind nun dank einiger Hersteller erh\u00e4ltlich, Kondensatoren werden daraus hergestellt, L\u00f6tzinn produziert, das FairPhone macht daraus ein Produkt, Intel bis Jahresende einen Prozessor.\n\nNun will die EU nachziehen und ebenfalls zur Transparenz beim Kauf von Rohstoffen aus Konflikt- und Risikogebieten verpflichten. Das k\u00f6nnte gro\u00dfe Wirkung auf unsere Elektronikprodukte haben. Wir sollten Einfluss auf die Ausformulierung nehmen, es droht n\u00e4mlich eine nur freiwillige, sanktionsfreie, nicht weitgehende Regelung, im Sinne der Industrie. \n\nWas wir aber brauchen, ist eine Regelung, die den Minenarbeitern wirksam hilft. Nur mit einer starken Gesetzgebung kann es uns gelingen, die Produktion von IT fairer zu gestalten.\n",

Trotz dem Umbau der Gesellschaft in eine marktkonforme Demokratie und zunehmender sozialer Spaltung, ist eine schlagkr\u00e4ftige au\u00dferparlamentarischen Bewegung nicht in Sicht. Es macht sich eine Ohnmacht breit, dass wir eh nichts \u00e4ndern k\u00f6nnen.\n\nEin Mittel gegen die Ohnmacht ist die kreative Weiterentwicklung des zivilen Ungehorsams.

Dabei setzt ziviler Ungehorsam darauf, dass viele Menschen die Regelverletzung moralisch mittragen k\u00f6nnen. Er setzt auf Verb\u00fcnden und Solidarit\u00e4t - und schafft damit auch Grundlagen f\u00fcr ein neues politisches Bewusstsein.\n",

It is intended to be a minimal or zero-configuration option that most Internet users can use to prevent non-consensual third party collection of their reading habits from their everyday browser. Privacy Badger couples the recently developed HTTP Do Not Track opt-out header with a number of heuristics for classifying the behavior of third parties, to automatically determine which should be blocked, which are needed but should have cookies blocked, and which are safe from a privacy perspective. They will also talk about the current state of non-consensual tracking on the web, what methods are currently being used to track people and exploring what alternatives we can pursue.",
        "description": "In this presentation I will address the state of online tracking. I will discuss the prevalence of tracking online, describe who is participating in it, explain the adverse effects for common web users, and then discuss what can be done to protect yourself from being tracked.\n\nWebsites have long ceased to be simple static html pages, and are now made up of many different resources distributed across the web. Over the course of a day of browsing the web, even if the number of sites we visit is small, we often broadcast information about the sites we go to to hundreds of third parties. These third parties have the ability to aggregate information about our browsing across many first party domains, enabling them to track what we read on the web. To many Internet users these third parties are invisible, and just as invisible are the ways in which they can uniquely identify you as you browse. As these forms of tracking become more ubiquitous and as data resellers grow in prevalence users need to have ways to protect themselves and their privacy.\n\nIn this talk I will cover the technical details of how third parties determine your identity on the web, and how they aggregate that information across websites. I will talk about the implications this has for web users' privacy and security. Additionally I will talk about the legal and policy work that has been done to rein in this sort of tracking. Finally I will discuss the Privacy Badger project, and how it protects users as they browse the web.\n\nThe talk will cover the following issues in detail:\nWays in which advertising companies track users, how spy agencies and other bad actors piggyback on this info, and how to stop them.\nSpecifically IP addresses, 'tracking' cookies, super cookies, and browser fingerprinting.\nHow you can protect yourself from these forms of data collection and how Privacy Badger works.\nWhy other kinds of privacy plug-ins and features fail to protect users from tracking\nWays that the EFF is working to rein in browsing tracking through law and policy.\n\nAfter this talk you will be informed about the types of tracking that occur online and feel empowered to do something to protect yourself from it. You will know how to follow future issues and understand current efforts to protect users and shape law.\n",

        "abstract": "WLAN and mesh networking in the UHF band: More frequency spectrum with greater range for better and cheaper broadband access for everyone. The digital dividend through the digitization of terrestrial TV offers an important opportunity for better coverage and more bandwidth for all. Unfortunately, the UHF-TV spectrum is being auctioned off to the big telecommunications companies. As a result, broadband usage remains expensive. The UHF-band mesh network of the \"Freifunk\" open wireless radio networks community in Berlin is a first step in a different direction.",
        "description": "Serious media use does not work without WiFi or LAN cable and also free and open wireless community infrastructure like Freifunk would be hardly conceivable without WLAN. 3G and 4G is good in between WiFi and LAN access just for frugal internet use.\n\nThe 2.4 GHz wireless frequency band is a big mess. Here, the WLAN users are crammed into only four non-overlapping WiFi channels\u00b9. In order to increase the chaos yet there's also remote-controlled toys, Bluetooth, wireless audio and video transmission systems, surveillance cameras, microwave ovens. Many of theses applications are transmitting uncoordinated. Scoffers refer to the 2.4 GHz band for its modest properties as 'junk band' - and yet it has become an important resource in our infrastructure, if not the most important resource alongside WLAN in the 5 GHz band. The 5 GHz WLAN frequency band offers more space, but because of even more pronounced quasi-optical properties, the range for local broadband coverage is even lower and soon also LTE networks are allowed to use this resource. (And LTE is going to share the spectrum in an unfair manner because of differences in the protocol, but that is a different subject.)\n\nThere are ways to improve the digital broadband coverage: Due to the switch of terrestrial analog TV to DVB-T, now a major part of the UHF TV frequency spectrum is unused - the digital dividend. This frequency range has substantially better properties than the radio channels at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz: objects such as trees and shrubs attenuate the signal much less. It is much easier to provide a broad range WLAN coverage in that part of the frequency spectrum.\n\nMuch of the TV band is soon to be auctioned to the telco industry or has already been auctioned. We always hear from politicians that the public purse has benefited enormously from the revenues from spectrum auctions. This warm rain for the Treasury is going to be financed by us, the Internet users and Telco customers, by the extra expense for broadband usage that we are spending. In effect, such spectrum auctions are a hidden tax for wireless broadband access.\n\nBut there might be a better way: A dedicated part of the currently unused TV channels could also be dedicated to unlicensed, digital broadband operation with WiFi. Everyone involved would benefit - the mobile operators, because the large telecommunications companies are already using unlicensed Wi-Fi to do \"mobile offloading\": Your DSL-WiFi router at home might already provide a commercial hotspot for the telecommunications company you are renting the DSL line from, in order to serve broadband to their customers on the street in front of your flat. The resulting cost savings for the large telcos are estimated to be over 80 billion in 2015.\n\nThe session presents the TV-Whitespace hardware project, which has been developed by Freifunk, its background and goals.\n\n(\u00b9 These are the channels 1, 5, 9, 13: The frequency channels between them should not be used it, as they interfere with the adjacent wireless channels and the channel access between different wireless networks can not be coordinated effectively.)",

It is based on a Wimax Transciever which sends I/Q samples in the range of 2.3 to 2.7 GHz to an ARM Cortex M4 CPU. The CPU then can then process them stand alone for various applications (like FM receiveing, Spectrogram display, RF Controlled power plugs, etc.) or send the samples via USB 2.0 to a Computer where they can be processed with the help of GNU Radio.\nThe extended frequency range is provided by a mixer that can be inserted into the RF path. For immedeate usage, the board contains a 2.5 GHz chip antenna which can be replaces with an easily soldered Antenna connector for usage in different frequency ranges.

        "description": "Outer space was once the sole province of nation-states and their military-industrial complexes, even serving as a theater for the Cold War between superpowers. In recent times, thanks to scientific advancements, reduced manufacturing costs, and increased sophistication in technology and materials, space science has become more commercially and publicly accessible now than in any other time in history - and many private individuals are taking the exploration of space into their own hands, often in direct partnership with formerly unapproachable government agencies.\n\nA new wave of administrators and executives in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have made great strides in releasing software and hardware technologies used in their space program, as well as the data and imagery produced by their missions, into the worldwide public domain. One of the most successful efforts on their part is the annually occurring grassroots, volunteer-run, community organized space hacker event known as the International Space Apps Challenge.\n\nIn just three short years, this global citizen effort has created hundreds of open source projects to overcome challenges and improve life on Earth and in space - and NASA continuously collaborates with the grassroots space hacker community in order to further spur open innovation.\n\nNew York City has been the \"global mainstage\" for the International Space Apps Challenge for two years running, hosted by its local chapter of space hackers: Space Apps NYC. At 1100 members and growing, Space Apps NYC is one of the world's premiere space hacker communities. Over 100 open source projects have been created by its members, and in 2015 their locally organized event included NASA's \"Women in Data\" bootcamp and a conference program of renowned speakers livestreamed worldwide.\n\nThis talk will cover some of the highlights and history of \"the galaxy's biggest hackathon\", describe and demonstrate some of the best projects created, and discuss the NASA resources that are made freely available for anyone in the world to use for any purpose.",

        "description": "After the Snowden revelations, demand for encrypted end-to-end communication has skyrocketed, even amongst ordinary users. As also shown by the catastrophic fate of Lavabit, running a high-security communications provider is fraught with danger, both political and technical. Yet today we see services that essentially sell security \"snake oil\" taking off with users, while real end-to-end encryption is barely used by activists, much less ordinary people. We still have do not have widespread deployment of OpenPGP, and post-email messaging protocols such as OpenWhisper still have less than a million users. Fundamental standards such as OpenPGP existing for over thirty years, but software such as Enigmail is still claimed to be virtually unusable. What is the source of this massive failure, and how can it be fixed? \n\n How can we combat the fundamental problems afflicting encrypted messaging, from e-mail to beyond, so that it becomes a fundamental right for all people to have end-to-end encrypted messaging? This roundtable will bring together software projects working in this space to reflect on their future, debate their differences, and possibly develop a common strategy for the future. Questions to be addressed are:\n\n1.  Are standards the solution or the problem? The IETF has recently re-opened the OpenPGP mailing list, and there is discussion around the Darkmail (DIME) protocols brewing. However, even the OpenPGP Working Group is not tackling the hard problems of metadata protection. Another strategy is to ditch e-mail entirely and go with new protocols such as TextSecure, but these protocols are still not federated and are thus centralized with particular applications. Decentralized blockchain-based messaging alternatives have also not taken off.\n\n2. Why is the software still unusable by ordinary users? Two years onwards, we still do not have a better interface than Thunderbird, which has been abandoned by Mozilla. Mailpile is still in beta. Pixelated is still under development. Furthermore, how do we communicate to users if their messages are secure or not?\n\n3. What research problems remain open? Currently, e-mail leaks metadata through the header, as well as through timing information and network traffic. Keyservers remain broken in terms of authentication and also reveal the social graph while key revocation and signing is difficult. Academic work on mix networking and privacy-enhancing technologies desperately needs to \n\n4. How can we reach critical mass? Some companies such as OpenWhisper are now working with major providers such as WhatsApp. Others such as LEAP are working so that anyone can run their own provider. Start-ups such as Peer.io and Protonmail are pursuing centralized strategies, and even Gmail and Yahoo! are working on end-to-end encryption. Governments such as Brazil and Germany are pushing for nationalized or public-private partnerships for encrypted email, while business models in the 'privacy market' are still unclear at best and seem to be unable to take into account distributed systems. \n\nThe goal of this even is to bring together key voices in this space so we combat the fundamental problems afflicting encrypted messaging, from e-mail to beyond, so that it becomes a fundamental right for all people to have end-to-end encrypted messaging.\n\n\n",

        "description": "Creating complicated multi-layered open source projects requires development, maintenance and ongoing commitments. Often, to do these things you need money. Paying developers and hackers can be a way for a project to work towards quality and sustainability, assuring that people have time to fix to bugs, handle support and work with others.\n\nThere is increasingly money available; however it often comes from source like governments, major tech companies, universities, and large foundations.  Each have their own missions and goals that are likely distinct from those of your project. The question becomes, if you decide to work with these funders, is it possible for your project to create and maintain a set of goals that are its own?\n\nTo be sure, this is not the only way to fund a project, and it is not a good fit for all projects.

We've discussed this at length amongst ourselves, and are curious to hear what CCC has to say.\n\nSome questions that we would like to see frame the discussion are:\n<ul>\n  <li>Is taking funding from governments and/or giant corporations to fund free software ethical at all?</li>\n  <li>If so, how do you decide your project's limits?</li>\n  <li>How do you figure out where your goals align or overlap with a funder's goals in ways that are helpful to your project?</li>\n  <li>How do you respond to allegations that your are doing your funder's dirty work?

        "description": "Production of milk is an incredibly energy, water and land intensive industry.  Couple that with spawning of antibiotic resistant bacteria caused by modern farming practices, along with the suffering of the animals themselves, and it's a full blown disaster.  At the same time, cheese is often cited by people as the reason they could never go vegan.  Vegan cheese substitutes have been increasing in quality, but still are not satisfying for many people.\n  In the modern age of genetic engineering, however, animals should not be needed to produce cheese.  It is a single protein complex, casein, which is responsible for most of cheese's properties such as melting and stretching.  The genes responsible for producing casein are sequenced for many animals, and so it should be possible to engineer other organisms, such as yeast, to make casein as well.  This is the goal of the Real Vegan Cheese project.\n  This project started in the spring of 2014 as a collaboration between Biocurious in Sunnyvale, CA and Counter Culture Labs in Oakland, CA.  Beyond the goal of producing a real cheese in a vegan process, we also formed to enter the international genetically engineered machines competition and show that community labs could compete with academic labs (tl;dr we won), and to provide alternative educational pathways for people interested in learning genetic engineering.  I will give an overview of the progress on these different aspects of our project including details of the science behind the project and current and future challenges.",

I felt bad and it was reverted quickly, never making it to the site. Still, I was surprised about how my colleagues reacted. They did not blame me! I felt support. These people have got my back. I experienced that it is okay to make mistakes and people trust me to fix them. After my years in gradschool this was a refreshingly new experience! Just two weeks ago, somebody within the company received the annual prize, our three-armed-sweater, for the most spectacular way to bring down the site. We joked that if somebody does not break the site to get the prize, they are not daring enough in their coding. I am still nervous when pushing new code to the site, but it feels like an exciting anticipation and respect for my work.\n\nPeople working with complex systems know they are brittle, because they are complex. Code that works well is nice, but working code also means everything is done - how boring! Programmers and builders live in a constant state of things-not-quite-working-yet, pushing this boundary every day. Even though it might be just software, this can be a challenging environment.\n\nProgramming culture is rife with stereotypes of lone-wolf coders. On hacker news, people like to \"well-actually\" each other. I did it, and maybe you do it too. Quite often, we face our coding questions all alone. With computers, we fight unforgiving machines, and usually the mistakes in our systems are based on human decisions. Programming in pairs and code reviews are techniques to improve these decisions by adding an extra set of eyes and opinions. These tools are excellent to use when working on a challenging complex system together and are known techniques by now.\n\nBut what about the quality of human interaction?

        "abstract": "In this talk we provide a practical introduction to Acoustic Cryptanalysis using tools and techniques that are easily grasped and cheaply available. The intention is not to present any new results, but instead the emphasis is on gaining a foundation in the theory of such attacks, so that you will be able to apply them more effectively in more challenging scenarios. As we shall see, such attacks are an extension of other types of side-channel attack (timing and power analysis attacks in particular), with the added promise of bridging air gaps.",
        "description": "We open by introducing the subject of side-channel attacks with a short review of them in general, and focus on key examples of acoustic cryptanalysis in the literature, including analysis of keyboard emanations, a brief look at an historical account of an attack on the Hagelin cipher machine that played a critical role in the Suez Crisis of the 1950's and the more recent results of Genkin, Shamir and Tromer, which forms the primary basis and inspiration of the techniques we will discuss.\nWe start the technical section of our talk by giving a background to power supplies for microcomputer systems, initially reviewing linear power supplies, so we have a basis on which we can compare them to the operating principles of switch-mode power supplies that form the key element of acoustic attacks. Along the way, we look at the important design principle of feedback and the relation this has to frequency response, which in turn gives us an estimate of the bandwidth of emanated signal available to us. Then, we explore the mechanisms by which key components of switch-mode power supplies can be caused to generate unwanted acoustics, show just how readily they will do so and how rich the spectral content of such signals can be.\nOur next task will be to look at signal acquisition techniques, where we scratch build an ultrasonic USB microphone with 125kHz of bandwidth, for a price at least two orders of magnitude cheaper than commercially available alternatives, yet still sensitive enough to capture the signals of interest. Specifically, we survey options for transducers, the design of the analog signal path and take a look at high data throughput techniques based on DMA to ensure that we can maintain the data rates required. We then discuss difficulties encountered in getting our signal from our data acquisition board into our data analysis system.\nSince a considerable amount of the literature on side-channel attacks, particularly simple and differential power analysis attacks, deals with attacks on block ciphers such the Advanced Encryption Standard, rather than public key cryptosystems such as RSA (as dealt with in the Genkin, Shamir and Tromer paper), the focus of our attack will be AES. We will quickly review the processing steps involved in AES and then develop a naive implementation of AES-128, paying particular attention to the construction of the S-boxes, since the data-dependent lookup times are the source of timing variations. Our attack is essentially an adaptation of the classic cache timing attack described by Daniel J. Bernstein, where the leaked timing information is obtained instead via the acoustic channel. Our target machine will be a netbook with an Intel Atom N270 (24kB L1 cache, 512KB L2 cache) together with a cheap and particularly noisy AC power supply (model PA-1700-02). We will discuss passive techniques to improve sound amplification in our test setup which will be familar to anyone who has played a stringed musical instrument.\nFinally, we move into the data processing and attack implementation section of the talk. In order to determine the run-time of our AES implementation for a given key, we will first need to be able to distinguish the difference in acoustic emanation of the system under load, compared to the idle-load condition. To do this, we will use the discrete-time Fourier transform of the acoustic signal, focusing on a suitable band of frequencies, where changes in amplitude correlate with CPU load changes. This will involve a discussion of the choice of FFT frame size against spectral resolution, choice of suitable windowing function and filtering techniques, to enable us to distinguish more accurately the transition from idle-load to load states.\nThe attack itself is conducted along the same lines as Bernstein's, with the victim machine running the AES process as a server to which we send UDP packets from our analysis machine, with plaintexts that are then encrypted by the server using its private key. The attack proceeds in two phases. The first involves using known keys and measuring the aggregate encryption time of each, thereby gathering statistics about key-dependent biases in the runtimes. In the second phase, the server chooses a random key which we are not told and we use the previously gathered statistics, together with data from a large sample of suitably chosen plaintexts, that we send to determine bit-by-bit the unknown private key. We spend some time considering options for statistical analyses that might lead to a possible reduction in the number of samples necessary to extract the complete key.\nConcluding the talk we discuss standard techniques to mitigate side-channel attacks found in the literature, as well as possible further extensions of the attack presented. It is hoped this will set the scene for the discussion section of the talk, where these ideas can be explored further.",

        "description": "A while ago I built a custom FPGA-board. It was fine but, I decided I also want some RAM. So why not DDR2? That also meant BGA chips. Things escalated quickly and I ended up with a 384-balls FPGA, BGA-RAM and whatnot.\nBecause I didn't have access to expensive software I hacked together quite a bunch of Lua scripts for analyzing and modifying Eagle XML boardfiles. I had the PCB made using a reasonably priced 6-layer pool process. For reflow soldering I got a cheap oven from China. Unfortunately it burned my dummy test-PCBs, so I had to reverse-engineer the firmware and write my own. After that I was able to solder the BGAs correctly and surprisingly the RAM did work without any errors at 800MHz.\nIt was time for a new challenge, so I tried designing a  board with PCI Express and Serial ATA. This one worked as well.\nThe implications are amazing: with some time, software skills and electronics know-how you can use state-of-the art technology in DIY-electronics without spending plenty of money on professional software and equipment.\nIn this talk I'll show you how it's done, things you need to consider (like wave impedance, terminations, length matching) and lessons I learnt along the way.",

        "description": "Over the past 5 years there has been an avalanche of revelations about the use of undercover agents against political movements: infiltrators that spend decades living and working with us, forming the most intimate relationships and accessing every single part of our lives. Infiltrators have been uncovered within political mobilisations in the UK, Germany, the USA, New Zealand, Spain etc., showing us that understanding offline security is just as vital as making our hardware and software secure. No matter how many layers of encryption we use, if our closest companions are infiltrators, sharing our homes, our lives, and our computers, there is nowhere to hide.\n   \nThis talk is given by three activists who were all targeted by UK police spy Mark Kennedy and who have direct personal experience of that and other physical surveillance. It will look at experiences of infiltration of social justice movements by the state and private contractors, some of our responses, and how that might relate to digital privacy struggles and resistance to other parts of the surveillance state\n\nIn an increasingly murky world of mass surveillance, cross-border cooperation, and political policing in the \"war on Terror\", these flesh-and-blood undercover agents may be working for the state police or secret services, or come from the increasingly large market of private surveillance contractors.  A report on policing published in 2014 in the UK estimated  that in that country alone there are currently 1,229 of undercover police officers operating both on and offline. \n\nIf you believe that mass surveillance is wrong but targeted surveillance is necessary; if you believe you will not be targeted because you are not a dissident (or you just make tools for dissidents!); if you have ever thought you are too ineffectual to be of interest to the political police, then this talk is for you. This happened to us because we did not imagine the lengths they would go to, and we are speaking out because if people know this is happening they are forewarned and forearmed against it.\n\nBIOS of the speakers:\n\n*'Lily'* has been active in social and environmental justice movements since the mid-1990s and is one of 8 women suing the London Metropolitan Police following the discovery that her partner of two years was in fact a police spy, one of several undercover officers sent to infiltrate groups she was active in. After starting to speak out, at 31c3, about her experiences of years of undercover abuses, human rights violations, and institutionalised police sexism, she began, again,  to receive police harassment, and in March 2015, at the CTF in Valencia, found a police GPS/GSM tracking device underneath her car.\n\ncontact: atikka at puscii dot nl\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/undercover-with-paul-lewis-and-rob-evans/2015/mar/11/woman-suing-police-over-relationship-with-undercover-spy-finds-tracking-device-in-her-car-reports\n\n====\n\n*Jason* has been involved in anti-authoritarian social movements since the late-1980s, and  recently discovered that a supposed close friend was actually an undercover police officer who targeted him across European borders for a period of five years. He is making a film, Spied Upon, about activists opposing state repression, and has a strategic analysis of state spying from the times of the Russian Czar,  the East German Stasi and the FBIs Cointelpro, that provides a context for understanding his own more personal recent experiences.\n\ncontact: jason at blackhelmetproductions dot net\n\nhttp://SpiedUpon.com\n\n====\n\n*Harry Halpin* is a Research Scientist at MIT working on cryptography, open standards, and decentralized social networking. For 5 years he was subjected to constant harassment, including laptop seizures, at borders and airports after he was placed on a 'terrorist'-style watch-list by by a British undercover police officer who was working with the FBI. He is currently fighting in court for the full disclosure of a Freedom of Information Act request detailing the contents of the 7,000+ pages the FBI has admitted they have collected, and fighting the Metropolitan Police in court over their use of 'national security' to violate Data Protection rules.\n\ncontact: halpin at csail dot mit dot edu\n\n====\n\n*Useful Links*\n\nhttps://policespiesoutoflives.org.uk\nhttps://people.torproject.org/~ioerror/skunkworks/forensics/valencia-tracking-device/\nhttp://campaignopposingpolicesurveillance.com/2015/04/28/we-are-all-targets-now/\nhttp://www.verfassung-schuetzen.de/",

Copy and paste the CCC/C3 approach into your community and create your own community-driven event. Not only for the free and open community, but free and open by design and by the way its organised and conducted.\n\nTonight we'll talk about hillhacks. We will explain what we have actually done at hillhacks 2014 and 2015, how we conquered the interesting and sometimes amusing challenges we encountered in the mountains, such as finding a suitable location, setting up, getting network there in the face of simian interference, paying the bills, and last but not least: getting \"the right people\" to do all the things.\n\nAfter that we introduce more community-driven events and spaces in India including various initiatives we feel strongly connected to.  We will present some of the exotic hacker- and makerspaces on the subcontinent, and the tech-community around these spaces.\n\nFinally we want to introduce some on-going important issues.  Primarily the big discussion about net-neutrality and the \"save-the-internet\" campaign which is a topic of significant interest in India right now.",

All these while spending less money than a night of beers!\n\nIn addition to the lecture, we will also run a workshop where we will show you more advanced techniques to break into microcontrollers using professional tools.

        "description": "We had a good run for a couple of years. Surveillance was mainstream and hackers' voices were heard. Snowden broke the barrier between the paranoids and the skeptics and amalgamated some consensus that all this surveillance is too much. But let's face it, we hoped for a better outcome. Surveillance bills are being passed in many European countries, the U.S. has taken little action and the United Kingdom is becoming the standard for privacy failures.\n\nGovernment hacking is on the rise, partially because of the increasing inability to wiretap due to the rise of encryption, but partially also because it has become inexpensive. While mass surveillance is a more obvious breach of human and constitutional rights, targeted surveillance is generally tolerated as a necessary evil. However, what we discovered is that this tolerance has nurtured not only an industry of surveillance, but an indiscriminate adoption of very invasive technologies and their legitimization and exemption from regulated use.\n\nAt the same time, while only cypherpunks have picked up the slack and started pushing development of encrypted communication technologies, the rest of the security and tech community has done little in response to the revelations of the last years as well as to the general cry for help. Hyped vulnerabilities, hacking of cars and gadgets is making headlines again, while the global civil society remains under heavy attack and is left helpless.\n\nIn this talk we'll go through many examples of targeted surveillance employed by governments all around the world and we'll try to understand the taxonomy and nature of these attacks from a technical and from a political perspective. We'll find that many share common characteristics and that in many cases we have the capacity to identify, track and stop these attacks, often directed against journalists, dissidents and activists in their countries and in exile.\n\nWhile civil society lacks the expertise and resources to research, understand and contrast these issues, the hacking and security communities exceeds and often drive the focus of their attention to rather unimportant problems. With a little good will and coordination, we can all collectively have a concrete impact, raise the cost of surveillance and make sure that those actually fighting for freedom and democracy around the world have the means to do so securely. Let's start now.\n",

        "abstract": "In the summer of 2013, Guardian employees destroyed computers storing top secret documents from Snowden, on instruction and supervision from GCHQ. With access to the destroyed pieces, we investigated what GCHQ's instructions were and what we can learn from it about securely eradicating data on a machine.",
        "description": "While the initial disclosures by Edward Snowden revealed how US authorities are conducting mass surveillance on the world's communications, further reporting by the Guardian newspaper uncovered that UK intelligence services were just as involved in this global spying apparatus. Faced with the prospect of further public scrutiny and accountability, the UK Government gave the Guardian newspaper an ultimatum: hand over the classified documents or destroy them.\n\nThe Guardian decided that having the documents destroyed was the best option. By getting rid of only the documents stored on computers in the UK, it would allow Guardian journalists to continue their work from other locations while acquiescing to the Government's demand. However, rather than trust that the Guardian would destroy the information on their computers to the Government's satisfaction, GCHQ sent two representatives to supervise the operation. Typically, reliable destruction of such hardware in the circumstances would be to shred or melt all electronic components using a much larger version of the common paper shredder and leaving only the dust of the original devices. Indeed, some devices such as external USB sticks were turned to dust.\n\nAlternatively, it might have been expected that GCHQ would solely target the hard drives of the devices in question. The hard drives, after all, are one of the few components of a computer where user data is supposed to be retained after the power to the device is removed.\n\nSurprisingly, however, GCHQ were not just interested in hard drives nor did they destroy whole devices. An examination of the targeted hardware by Privacy International, with cooperation from the Guardian, has found the whole episode to be more troubling and puzzling than previously believed.\n\nDuring our investigation, we were surprised to learn that a few very specific components on devices, such as the keyboard, trackpad and monitor, were targeted along with apparently trivial chips on the main boards of laptops and desktops. Initial consultation with members of the technology community supported our identification of the components and that the actions of GCHQ were worth analysing further.\n\nIn light of GCHQ's actions, we have asked hardware manufacturers to explain what these elements actually do: what information can be stored on a device, how much information it can retain, and for how long.",

Being reflected in data might do more harm to those marginalised communities, for whom operating under the radar or anonymously might be crucial to their livelihoods. \n\nWhat can we learn from the way in which different marginalised communities have been reflected in data in the past?

This talk is going to explain why is it important to have them - food & drink biotech is a huge sector where mostly corporate doctrines ruled so far, having minimal ethical and moral challengers, therefore building up a know how fallowing the principles described above is crucial. This presentation will describe how the centers can be started based on previous experience. It will discuss variety of options how to get funding to open its doors and consequently how to keep the lights on. Also the legal structure like for-profit, non-profit etc will be discussed. \n\nIn summary the aim is to share the experience about how to start up places like this to stimulate their spread, interlinking them and helping them to prosper. It is also a call for building up place like this in Europe.  \n\nAs a demonstration fallowing project can be run by the Experimental Fermentation Institute focusing on a fermentation biotech. This project is focused on promotion and development of food sustainability in local rural communities using variety of fermentation cultures and techniques. The goal is to use the regionally available alimentary resources, preserve them in the time of abundance for periods when they are scarce and process part of them into higher value products for recreational use and trade. This is going to be achieved by selecting appropriate fermentation cultures/microbes and adequate techniques which will be combining the traditional knowledge and state of the art technology, resulting in scheme aimed on small to medium production. Fermentation facility will be designed to suit the needs of rural areas including production, educational and experimental purposes. Next step will be creation of training program which will allow to the interested participants to master these techniques and carry out the production. As the final step, the participants will be motivated to start their own businesses supporting therefore the green collar worker scheme and local economy. All of the developments in this project will be based on open source approach and shared with community. ",

While manufacturers do not optimize their cars for bio-fuels, it is a fairly straightforward process to do this by tuning the cars ECU (Electronic Control Unit). To solve this problem of a lack of bio-fuels production in the developing world (and even in many western nations also!), a group of technologists in Costa Rica are working on open source designs for personal bio-fuels production equipment. These designs aim to be cheap and simple to construct, and use various forms of bio-waste as the primary input to produce the fuels. In this talk I will discuss the global context and outline the project's goals.

The speaker of this talk discovered that the software Privdog, advertised by the certificate authority Comodo, had an even worse vulnerability.\n\nSuperfish and Privdog were extreme examples, but the technology of intercepting HTTPS connections by installing X.509 root certificates into the browser is widespread. These solutions are often part of software that is supposed to bring more security to the user - like Antivirus applications - but they lower the user's security. For example Kaspersky Antivirus users were still affected by the FREAK vulnerability months after the issue was found and fixed.\n\nThe talk will first give an introduction into some problems in the TLS protocol that were found in recent years (BEAST, CRIME, FREAK, CA failures) and show some technologies that were invented to prevent common problems of TLS (e. g. HPKP). After that the speaker will give some examples of TLS interception software and how it endangers the security of the user.",

For example, the field of biology changed forever after the microscope revealed the existence of cells. In this talk I will discuss some of the great leaps in technology in astronomy, and what those technologies have allowed us to learn about the nature of the universe. \n\nThe focus will be on discoveries made possible by modern detector technologies, using mm wavelength superconducting cryogenic bolometers and the cosmic microwave background as the example.\n\nMoving forward, astronomy is entering an era of big data. Computation is becoming an increasingly important part of astronomy, and as with any new technology, we can expect new scientific discoveries as it becomes mature. The field is starting to embrace open source software and hardware, and the power of the internet to fuel new scientific discoveries. ",

        "subtitle": "Questioning privacy, data protection, and autonomy in the field",
        "abstract": "Satellite imagery has been used since the 1960s to monitor agricultural activities at a national and international level. It is only now that the image quality and cost feasibility have made satellite imagery available to individual farmers in application to crop quality analysis, yield prediction, and other measures related to precision farming.  Farmers can now pinpoint problem areas of their fields and address them on the spot, rather than blanketly spraying fertilizer and pesticides, which has the potential for environmental and economic benefits.  However, this development has launched agriculture into new territory ridden with issues of privacy, data protection, and autonomy of farm inputs and activities. This is a discussion of the state of affairs in agricultural earth observation and what we can do to ensure that it is used for improved practices and not against the producers of our food.",
        "description": "In 2013 the artist Mishka Henner produced the work, \"Feedlots.\"  It is a series of satellite images he found of selected cattle feedlots across Texas.  Across the images one can objectively observe the the adverse effects of irresponsible farming practices.  This represents the transparency and accountability that satellite imagery can enable.\n\nAt the same time, farmers were adopting precision agricultural technologies which used vegetation indices such as NDVI derived from near infra-red satellite imagery to track the progress of their crops and detect areas that didn't have enough water or nutrients.  The digitisation of fields and creation of field analysis software means that farmers can download the data on a USB stick, plug it into a tractor, and apply fertiliser exactly where it is needed, which brings environmental and economic benefits.\n\nHowever, as with the introduction of most new technologies there are potential issues that come along with our inexperience in these new territories.  Privacy issues related to who can access and order satellite imagery of different farms, and to what degree of resolution. Data security issues for farmers to work out with the agritech companies offering the internet based services. Questions of, 'who owns my data and what can they use it for?' are coming up across the cornfields of the Midwest of the United States.\n\nAdditionally, companies that offer farming software also offer seeds, chemical fertilisers, and a whole suite of products that they oblige farmers to use.  Just as Apple encourages users to use their line of synchonised products, agritech firms want farmers to start farming literal apples with their line of seeds that correspond to the fertiliser, pesticide, and the price calculations of their cloud farm planning tool.\n\nThese are issues that were never encountered by the agricultural community before, and recognition and new solutions at the onset of this new era are necessary for the future of our food.\n\n",

Over the past decades my life has changed dramatically on a number of occasions, first by finding out about being intersex, then trying to find some way to deal with it.\n\nDuring this time, it was the internet which provided me not only with a way to learn about a medical condition which I had never even heard about, which provided me with options, which brought me into contact with others like me, and so much more.\n\nIt also allowed my voice to carry far and wide, throughout the world, enabling me to reach and educate others, changing lives forever. It got me into contact with a publisher for my autobiography (which I promise to finish one day, really), which - once published - could change the lives of millions.\n\nMaybe most important of all, thanks to the internet I was able to keep a window open towards a better tomorrow for myself. Despite everything, thanks to the internet I'm still here, still got a future and - most importantly - a life.",

This talk investigates the state of openness in this hitherto very closed area of the IT industry.\n\nUntil a few years ago, getting any information on network switch or router hardware required an NDA. Getting the required SDK or drivers to write open source software for these devices was impossible, even buying switches with an open operating system was difficult if not impossible.\n\nThis changed with the introduction of the Open Compute Project and OpenFlow. The first introduced pressure on the switch ASIC vendors to open up, the latter provides an API for switch hardware, and comes with an open source ecosystem. As an exemplary result, Broadcom, an incumbent switch ASIC vendor, released open API information on their switch ASICs (SAI, OF-DPA, SDKLT), as well as driver blobs for open source operating systems.\nThis, in combination with bare-metal switches and a standardized OS installer, kicked off a wide array of Linux-based operating systems.\n\nIn this talk investigates the different aspects of networking hardware and their respective state of openness as well as opportunities for implementing new ideas and open source contributions. The goal of the talk is to spread the awareness of this topic and provide an architectural overview on the area.\n\nThis talk is based on my experiences during my work as a research assistant in the field of Software-Defined Networking and Networks Function Virtualization at Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt.",

Also, the application allows for replaying recorded data back to the Arduino for signal injection into the quadcop's remote control.\n* The next step would be to extend the Java application for either editing recorded flight control data or creating completely new flight control data from scratch.\n\nSchematics and software are available as open source licensed under GNU GPL v3, see here:\nhttps://github.com/soundpaint/QuadCopHack",

        "description": "Why would someone create a programming language that can't be programmed in and, if it can't be programmed in, is it a programming language? Esolangs (esoteric programming languages) have long challenged the norms of programming practice and computing culture. Most esolangs are experiential works; we understand the languages by writing code in them. Through this action, the logic of the language becomes clear. However, a smaller subset of esolangs make their point not through actively writing code, but instead by simply contemplating their rules. We can think of these as conceptual rather than experiential. The most extreme are designed in such a way that they don\u2019t allow any code to be written for them at all. By stepping away from usability, the conceptual esolangs offer the most direct challenge to the definition of programming language, a term which is surprisingly unspecific, and usually understood through utility, despite the fact that programming languages predate digital computers. This paper delves into the conceptual esolangs and looks at their challenge to the terms computer, code, and  language.\n\nThis talk is an expanded version of the paper published with CITARJ available here: http://artes.ucp.pt/citarj/article/view/432",

        "abstract": "Hold Steering Wheel! Differences in Automation Between Aircraft and Road Vehicles\n\nFor decades, airliners and also small aircraft have been flying large portions of their flight, including landing, on autopilot. So why is it so hard to get autonomous driving \"on the road\"? I will briefly talk about aviation and aviation safety, the role of automation in commercial aviation, its benefits, but also its pitfalls and dangers, and compare it to technology in road cars, from simple driver-assist functions up to full Level-5 autonomy (door-to-door without any human intervention or supervision). There are things that are fundamentally different between flying an aircraft and driving a car, most notably the environment, but also levels of training and proficiency, maintenance as well as questions of ethics and liability.",

Disseminate love! \u2665\n\nNo hurtful comments. We want people of every sexuality, origin, gender identity, body shape, etc., to feel comfortable, so treat everyone with respect. Ask and use people\u2019s preferred pronouns. The line is drawn not at whether something is \"objectively\" wrong or evil, but whether it's hurting somebody. Everyone makes mistakes \u2014 please take yours as an opportunity to learn and grow, and be compassionate. Being a nice human being is more important than being right.\n\nNo harassment: only \"yes\" means \"yes\". Munches are relaxed social gatherings, not dating events \u2014 adjust your expectations accordingly. If you have trouble reading signals or are sometimes awkward in social situations, that's okay! You're not the only one. However, insisting when somebody tells you that they're not interested is harassment. Physical touching without explicit consent is also harassment.",

With more and more companies moving to cloud, the security of cloud becomes a major concern.\n\nWhile AWS and GCP provide you protection with traditional security methodologies and has a neat structure for authorization/configuration, their security is as robust as the person in-charge of creating/assigning these configuration policies. As we all know, human error is inevitable and any such human mistake could lead to catastrophic damage to the environment.\n\nFew vulnerable scenarios: \n- Your security groups, password policy or IAM policies are not configured properly\n- S3 buckets are world-readable \n- Web servers supporting vulnerable ssl ciphers\n- Ports exposed to public with vulnerable services running on them\n- If root credentials are used\n- Logging or MFA is disabled\nAnd many more such scenarios...\n\nKnowing all this, audit of cloud infrastructure becomes a hectic task ! There are a few open source tools which help in cloud auditing but none of them have an exhaustive checklist. Also, collecting, setting up all the tools and looking at different result sets is a painful task. Moreover, while maintaining big infrastructures, system audit of server instances is a major task as well.\n\nCS Suite is a one stop tool for auditing the security posture of the AWS & GCP infrastructure and does OS audits as well.

        "subtitle": null,
        "abstract": "Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) is an open authentication standard that strengthens and simplifies two-factor authentication and has been used by Facebook, Google, Github etc. The keys stored in U2F tokens with secure element chips are considered impossible to be extracted. However, the capability of key pairs storage is limited by secure element chips, FIDO U2F standard allows a key wrapping mechanism which enables unlimited key pairs with limited storage. It's considered safe, but not with an evil manufacturer.\n\nIn this talk, we will give a real-world example of U2F phishing attack by retrieving the master secret from an open source U2F token during the manufacturing process and then give that U2F token to a victim user. Then we can clone that U2F token by implementing the same key wrapping mechanism with the master secret recorded. We will give a demo that Github, Gmail, Facebook can be affected using this kind of U2Fishing method.\n\nSome countermeasures will be discussed. Investigating some websites that provide U2F as a two-factor authentication method, we found out that some of them haven't implemented cloning detection function which is recommended by FIDO Alliance so that U2Fishing victims will not be aware of when the attack is started.\n\nThis attack will still work even if cryptography secure element chip such as Atmel ATECC508A is used by U2F token with key wrapping mechanism. It's recommended that end users should at least do a master secret regeneration process when given a new U2F token with key wrapping mechanism. It's currently unavailable for Yubikey.",
        "description": "More details \n------------\n\nBasically, it's because FIDO standard allows Key Wrapping Mechanism.  So that the U2F device can only keep a master secret when secure storage capacity has a limit.\n\nhttps://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-u2f-v1.0-nfc-bt-amendment-20150514/fido-u2f-overview.html#allowing-for-inexpensive-u2f-devices\n\nMy attack scenario is: \n\n1. The attacker extracts the master key during the manufacturing process of an open-source U2F key, in my case is U2F Zero. \n2. Attacker clone this U2F key. (In my case, I integrated it with a software U2F implementation.)\n3. Attacker gives this U2F key to a victim.\n4. assume the victim use this U2F key to register with Google. \n5. Attacker gets to know the password from another source. (such as social engineering, or other ways of password phishing)\n6. Login.\n\nYou can find my PoC here:\n\nhttps://github.com/scateu/U2Fishing/blob/master/03-key-wrapping.py\n\nIn fact, this attack can be detected when an anti-clone counter is well checked, because:\n\n1. It's needed that attacker chooses a bigger counter number so that it's bigger than the last counter number that victim used to login. The best luck of the attack is choosing a counter number only 1 bigger than the counter number in the victim's device.\n2. The next time when the victim login, his counter number is smaller than the number recorded on the website.\n3.1 Maybe the victim think it is just a matter of network issue, and ignore it. And try again (the counter will increase by 1), and login successfully. In this case, the attacker will not be noticed.\n3.2 When the counter number chosen by the attacker is much bigger, the victim will never login to the website again. Because the victim has to press the button on the U2F device a lot of times to make the counter bigger than the last success counter recorded on the website.\n3.3 Another chance is that the website doesn't check the counter at all.\n\nAfter some investigation, I found out that when a counter number revert incident occurs:\n\n1. Some website like Gmail doesn't give a prompt, the webpage doesn't even blink. I don't think a victim will notice anything when this happens.\n2. Worse, my email provider Fastmail.com doesn't check the counter at all. That means, at first victim login with a counter number (say 123), then the attacker login with a bigger counter number (say 9999) to pass the counter check, then victim login with a counter number plus one (this time, 124). Fastmail.com will not check. I have already written to them, and get confirmed.\n\n\nA quick view of my experiment on youtube: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axKrtrOTfcY\n\nYubikey doesn't offer secret key regeneration.  You can see an official answer from https://forum.yubico.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=2484\n\nAs for other U2F keys, https://github.com/hillbrad/U2FReviews provides a glance at Yubico U2F Security Key, Thetis U2F Security Key, Feitian ePass, Bluink, KEY-ID FIDO U2F Security Key, HyperFIDO Mini, HyperFIDO U2F Security Key, Plug-Up Card Key, Fidesmo Card, SurePassID TapID Card, Feitian MultiPass and VASCO DigiPass SecureClick. At least none of them allegedly supports secret key regeneration.",

To be free also includes to have the freedom to use your computer without having to fear of getting compromised or anyone listening to your communication. GNOME takes tries hard to put the user back into the control seat regarding security and privacy. We will see two examples of how GNOME gives you back that control. The first is a classic: The problem of signing OpenPGP keys. The second is the protection against malicious USB devices.",
        "description": "The new GNOME 3.24 brings many visible improvements will be delivered to users around the world.    While many people already excitedly use GNOME 3 with the new user experience, some features of the new and elegant desktop like LibreOffice integration or editing photos with non-destructive GEGL operations are not yet wildly known. We also did many things on the plumbing layer such as containerisation of apps using Flatpak.\n\nIn this talk, you will see examples of how GNOME tries to give you back control over your computing. Firstly, we have Flatpak, the containerisation of desktop apps. With Flatpak, users can sandbox their applications while still having them integrated into their desktop, e.g. have them started like native apps, have them print documents, or open and save files. This level of integration make it arguably more complex than, say, using Docker or rkt to run your applications. Secondly, GNOME tries to address the problem of signing OpenPGP keys. Currently, that is a tedious process with many things that can (and will) go wrong. Finally, a prototypical protection against malicious USB devices is shown. Do you know when you use your USB? And when you don't? And, more importantly, when someone uses your USB? We present an approach which may be well suited for preventing abuse of your computing.\n\n",

Goog\u00adle un\u00adtersucht dar\u00adaufhin die Si\u00adtuati\u00adon und best\u00e4tigt sei\u00adne Vermu\u00adtung: es gab Angriffe auf die Verschl\u00fcsselung der Kommunikati\u00adon, wovon prim\u00e4r In\u00adternetnutzer im Iran betroffen wa\u00adren. Die Zertifizierungs\u00adstel\u00adle DigiNo\u00adtar habe un\u00adter an\u00adde\u00adrem f\u00fcr goog\u00adle.com nicht autorisier\u00adte Zertifikate aus\u00adge\u00adstellt, die von Browsern an\u00adstands\u00adlos akzep\u00adtiert wur\u00adden. Allein der kurz vor dem Vorfall ver\u00f6ff\u00adentlich\u00adten Si\u00adcherheits\u00adfunkti\u00adon des Chro\u00adme-Browsers sei es zu ver\u00addanken, dass das missbr\u00e4uch\u00adlich verwende\u00adte Zertifikat bemerkt wurde. Die neue Si\u00adcherheits\u00adfunkti\u00adon pr\u00fcfe f\u00fcr den Goog\u00adle E-Mail-Dienst Gmail nicht nur, ob das Zertifikat g\u00fcltig ist, sondern auch ob es von ei\u00adner autorisier\u00adten Zertifizierungs\u00adstel\u00adle aus\u00adge\u00adstellt wurde.\nIn Chro\u00adme und an\u00adde\u00adren Browsern wur\u00adden sofort alle Zertifikate ge\u00adsperrt, die von DigiNo\u00adtar aus\u00adge\u00adstellt wur\u00adden. Die Zertifizierungs\u00adstel\u00adle, die seit Juli 2011 von den nicht autorisier\u00adten Zertifika\u00adten f\u00fcr Domains von Goog\u00adle, dem CIA, dem Mossad, dem MI6 und an\u00adde\u00adren wusste, wurde unter die Aufsicht nieder\u00adl\u00e4ndi\u00adscher Beh\u00f6rden gestellt und es wurde ein Ermittlungs\u00adverfah\u00adren ein\u00adge\u00adleitet. \n\nKommt ein Angreifer in den Besitz ei\u00adnes nicht autorisier\u00adten aber g\u00fcltigen Zertifikats, sind verschl\u00fcsselte Ver\u00adbindun\u00adgen nicht mehr si\u00adcher. Der Angreifer w\u00fcrde sich mit ei\u00adnem Man-in-the-Middle-Angriff zwi\u00adschen zwei Kommunikati\u00adons\u00adpartner set\u00adzen und das g\u00fcltige Zertifikat pr\u00e4sentie\u00adren. Dieses wird akzep\u00adtiert, da der Client Zertifika\u00adten der nicht mehr vertrau\u00adensw\u00fcrdigen Zertifizierungs\u00adstel\u00adle vertraut. Die Kommunikati\u00adon wird abgeh\u00f6rt.\n\nDas Pro\u00adblem mit Zertifika\u00adten ist nicht neu. Aus diesem Grund wur\u00adden in der Vergan\u00adgenheit meh\u00adre\u00adre M\u00f6glichkei\u00adten zur Ab\u00adsi\u00adcherung gegen fal\u00adsche Zertifikate vor\u00adge\u00adschla\u00adgen. Beispiele sind Certificate Transparency, DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities oder auch HTTP Public Key Pinning. Certificate Transparency ist zudem topaktuell, da der Internetgigant Google dieses Verfahren f\u00fcr https-Verbindungen in seinem Chrome Browser im Oktober 2017 verpflichtend einf\u00fchren wird.\n\nDer Vortrag gibt einen kurzen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber Public Key Infrastrukturen und Zertifikate und stellt L\u00f6sungsans\u00e4tze f\u00fcr das beschriebene Vertrauensproblem vor.",

Darauf basierend werden (informations)technische Herausforderungen zur Integration eines hohen Anteils erneuerbarer, fluktuierender Energiequellen erl\u00e4utert. Hervorzuheben sind dabei insbesondere der Bedarf eines st\u00e4ndigen Ausgleichs von Erzeugung und Verbrauch (\u00f6konomisches Gleichgewicht durch Stromm\u00e4rkte, technische Frequenzhaltung durch \u00dcbertragungsnetzbetreiber) sowie die Lastflussumkehr durch vermehrt dezentrale Einspeisung in Verteilnetzen (erschwerte Spannungshaltung f\u00fcr Verteilnetzbetreiber).\n\nIn diesem Kontext wird insbesondere auf Smart-Meter-Gateways eingegangen, welche gem\u00e4\u00df dem neuen \u201eGesetz zur Digitalisierung der Energiewende\u201c in den kommenden Jahren bei Stromverbrauchern teilweise verpflichtend verbaut werden m\u00fcssen.

FreeBSD ist ein direkter Abk\u00f6mmling des an der Universit\u00e4t von Kalifornien in Berkeley entwickelten freien 4.4-BSD Betriebssystems. Seit 1993 ist dieses Open Source-Projekt mit \u00fcber 100 weltweiten Entwicklern (sog. Committern) eines der am l\u00e4ngsten existierenden Unix-Derivate. Innovationen wie BSD Sockets, der original TCP/IP-Stack, Jails zur Kompartmentalisierung von Anwendungen und viele weitere sind dank der unternehmensfreundlichen BSD-Lizenz f\u00fcr alle zug\u00e4nglich. FreeBSD ist ein komplettes Betriebssystem, dass sowohl Kernel als auch Bibliotheken und Anwendungsprogramme (Userland) gr\u00f6sstenteils selbst entwickelt. Dabei wird grosser Wert auf Kompatibilit\u00e4t zu anderen Unix-Systemen gelegt.",
        "description": "Der Vortrag gew\u00e4hrt einen Blick hinter die Kulissen des Projekts. Besonderer Fokus gilt der Struktur des Projekts und dessen Organisation. FreeBSD ist eines der \u00e4ltesten Projekte mit einer demokratisch gew\u00e4hlten Leitung (Core Team). Die einzelnen Teams wie src, ports und doc werden vorgestellt und deren Verantwortlichkeiten geschildert. Ebenso wird auf Ma\u00dfnahmen eingegangen, die das Projekt getroffen hat, um einerseits Burnout bei Langzeitteilnehmern zu vermeiden und andererseits Nachr\u00fccker zu ermutigen, sich selbst und neue Ideen einzubringen. Erfahrene Committer f\u00fchren durch das Mentoringkonzept Neulinge in das Projekt ein, bis diese selbstst\u00e4ndig und ohne Aufsicht \u00c4nderungen vornehmen k\u00f6nnen.\nIm Vortrag werden auch die Tools vorgestellt, mit denen das Projekt seine bew\u00e4hrte Qualit\u00e4t, Stabilit\u00e4t und Sicherheit gew\u00e4hrleistet. Dazu z\u00e4hlen u.a. Code-Reviews, Continuous Integration und Coverity Scans. Das Projekt arbeitet dabei Hand in Hand mit der Community, bestehend aus Einzelpersonen, Unternehmen, als auch anderen Open Source-Projekten. Beispielsweise l\u00e4sst sich FreeBSD komplett mit LLVM/Clang \u00fcbersetzen und integriert DTrace und OpenZFS.\nZum Schluss des Vortrags wird die FreeBSD Foundation vorgestellt. Diese k\u00fcmmert sich um die finanzielle und rechtliche Seite des Projekts. Viele Dinge wie die Vereinbarung von Non-Disclosure Agreements mit Entwicklern, Sponsoring von Konferenzen, das Sammeln von Spenden, Hardwarek\u00e4ufe f\u00fcr Projektserver und der Schutz der Marke FreeBSD sind nur einige der Aufgaben dieser in den USA als gemeinn\u00fctzig aner- kannten Stiftung.\nMit diesem Vortrag soll das Projekt interessierten Zuh\u00f6rern (mit und ohne Vorwissen) n\u00e4her gebracht werden. Es sollen auch die Erfahrungen, welche das Projekt \u00fcber viele Jahre im Open Source Bereich gemacht hat, weitergegeben werden.",

        "description": "Ein paar statische Seiten ausliefern klingt einfach. Manpages von einem Betriebssystem auszuliefern klingt wie etwas, was schon etliche Male erledigt wurde. Wenn man jedoch ein bisschen genauer hinschaut, stellt man schnell fest, dass man einige Wochen darauf aufwenden kann, wenn einem die Details wichtig sind.\n\nAls einfaches Beispiel: man kann nicht einfach alle Dateien unter /usr/share/man/ extrahieren. Schlie\u00dflich enthalten unterschiedliche Debian-Bin\u00e4rpakete Manpages mit dem selben Namen: mysqld(8) ist beispielsweise sowohl in mariadb-server-core-10.0 als auch in mysql-server-core-5.5 enthalten.\n\nGenerell, wenn man lediglich Manpages aus Paketen extrahiert, macht man es sich zu einfach. Beliebte Pakete wie vi(m) oder ganeti benutzen das Konzept der \u201eslave alternative\u201c-Symlinks, damit die Manpage /usr/share/man/man1/vi.1 auch auf genau die derzeit bevorzugte/installierte Variante von vi (oder Version von ganeti) zeigt. Diese Indirektion wird zur Installationszeit (!) von einem shell-Script (!) aufgesetzt.\n\nZu diesem inh\u00e4rent schwierigen Datensatz kommen hohe Anspr\u00fcche an moderne Websites und betagte Hardware als Laufzeitumgebung hinzu, und schon steht man vor einem interessanten Problem.\n\nKommt zu meinem Vortrag f\u00fcr haufenweise interessante Details und Fun-Facts!",

In order to achieve secure software, developers must be supported and helped by the organization they author code for. As software developers author the code that makes up a web application, they need to embrace and practice a wide variety of secure coding techniques. All tiers of a web application, the user interface, the business logic, the controller, the database code and more \u2013 all need to be developed with security in mind. This can be a very difficult task and developers are often set up for failure. Most developers did not learn about secure coding or crypto in school. The languages and frameworks that developers use to build web applications are often lacking critical core controls or are insecure by default in some way. It is also very rare when organizations provide developers with prescriptive requirements that guide them down the path of secure software. And even when they do, there may be security flaws inherent in the requirements and designs. When it comes to software, developers are often set up to lose the security game.\n\nThe OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls 2016 is a list of security techniques that should be included in every software development project. They are ordered by order of importance, with control number 1 being the most important. This document was written by developers for developers to assist those new to secure development.",

Die kanadische Firma D-Wave behauptet, Quantencomputer mit bis zu 512 Qubits gebaut zu haben. Derzeitiger Standart in der Forschung sind ca. 5-10 Qubits. Quantencomputer sollen in der Lage sein, manche Probleme deutlich schneller zu l\u00f6sen als klassische Rechner. Was genau dieses \"schneller\" ist, h\u00e4ngt von dem betrachteten Problem ab.\nDas Problem bei der Herstellung von Quantencomputern sind Dekoher\u00e4nzeffekte, die bei einem Anstieg der Qubits auftreten und die Superposition zerst\u00f6ren, sodass der Computer nicht mehr nutzbar wird. Ob solche Dekoher\u00e4nzeffekte auch bei den D-Wave-Rechnern aufgrund der hohen Anzahl an Qubits auftreten und ob wirklich eine Beschleunigung m\u00f6glich ist, ist momentan noch umstritten. Ich m\u00f6chte einen \u00dcberblick zu dem Thema geben, wie Quantencomputer normalerweise funktionieren (Circuit Model), wie ein adiabatischer Quantencomputer (D-Wave) grunds\u00e4tzlich arbeitet und was bei diversen Studien rausgefunden wurde. Am Anfang werde ich noch ein paar theoretische Dinge zur Quantenmechanik (Superposition, Normierung, exponentieller Anstieg der Dimensionalit\u00e4t des Tensorproduktraumes) sagen.",

        "description": "Als Entwickler am Haskell-Compiler GHC war ich auf der Suche nach einem Tool, dass die Leistung des Compilers im Laufe der Entwicklung sch\u00f6n darstellt. Ich habe eine Weile mit \u201ecodespeed\u201c gearbeitet, war aber nicht zufrieden. Insbesondere konnte es nicht viel mit den Eigenheiten von Git anfangen. Daher habe ich ein neue Tool geschrieben: gipeda.\n\nKnapp formuliert nimmt gipeda Daten im Format \u201eGit-Commit-ID; Benchmarkname; Wert\u201c entgegen und macht daraus eine Webseite mit sch\u00f6nen Tabellen und Graphen. \n\nEin besonderes Feature ist, dass gipeda eine statische Webseite erzeugt, so dass man die Ausgabe ohne gro\u00dfen Aufwand irgendwo hosten kann. Man kann es auch einfach lokal laufen lassen, und es m\u00fcssen ja keine Benchmarks sein, die man misst: Ich habe damit auch den Fortschritt meiner Dissertation (gemessen in durch Tinte bedeckte Fl\u00e4che) verfolgt.\n\nIn meinem Vortrag stellet Joachim gipeda vor, demonstriert kurz alle Features der Benutzeroberfl\u00e4che und zeigt, wie Ihr es selbst aufsetzt. \nGipeda selbst ist nicht f\u00fcr das Sammeln der Benchmark-Daten zust\u00e4ndig; das erledigt bei mir ein kleines Shell-Skript, das ich zeigen werden; es gibt aber auch Tools f\u00fcr diesen Zweck, wie https://github.com/sgraf812/feed-gipeda, welches Sebastian Graf vorstellen wird.\n",

        "description": "How much do we live in different worlds, when we search for political topics online? Germany has an upcoming election, and nobody really knows much about the knowledge spheres internet users find themselves in. This is in contrast to those spheres in our well-established newspaper and magazine landscape. To alleviate this gap of knowledge, Algorithm Watch has set up the \"Datenspende Bundestagswahl 2017\", a plugin for firefox and chrome which automatically searches for 16 keywords and submits the data to a central server. The keywords consists of the full name of the most important politicians and the seven largest parties. The harvested data is public and can be analyzed by anyone. The project was funded by a consortium of German media authorities and is supported by SpiegelOnline as our media partner. (datenspende.algorithmwatch.org)\n\nIn this talk I will give you some first insights into the variance of search results different people get. While we do not know anything about our users - for data protection reasons - we can see that for some keywords, there are clusters of people getting different results while for others the results are very homogeneous. In all cases analyzed so far, the amount of variance is less than expected based on a full personalization of search engine results and more varied than expected based on a mere regionalization. \n\nThe main result of the project, however, is that is a proof-of-concept showing that  society is actually able to audit socially relevant algorithms by combining the efforts of individuals - both as data donors and  data analysts. This principle has to be transferred to audit other social platforms that are even more likely to influence public opinion than search engines, especially social networks. Today, however, most of them do not offer the technical tools for society to be able to do that. This has to be changed.",

No company or product is an exception, the current industry modus-operandi is \"collect-as-you-can\" and it is bound to produce privacy side effects.  \n\nWe would like to share an alternative approach based on client-side aggregation. This talk will showcase how it is perfectly possible to collect and anonymously send data without any user identifiers or PII for building data driven products like a browser with a fully integrated search engine (Cliqz), Anti-tracking, Anti-phishing etc. without risking or compromising the users privacy at any time.",
        "description": "Privacy by Design means that the complete architecture right from collection, processing, serving the data is built with privacy and security in mind from the ground up. The term Big Data needs little introduction; it is the foundation of today's services, without this most of the services that we enjoy today could not exists not exist. \nThe industry modus-operandi can be described as \"collect-all-you-can\", this behavior is not only accepted but encouraged. This approach to data collection, however is dangerous especially when data involves our everyday actions and when the subject of data collection involves human actions on the Web, side-effects are something to be considered seriously. \nWhat is a side-effect in context of data collection ? In simple terms, a piece of knowledge that can be learned from data analysis which was neither intended nor expected, and that poses a risk to the privacy of the subjects of the data collection. During this talk we will provide evidences of side-effects on popular systems such as google analytics that compromise the privacy of the users, even to the point of obtaining personal identifiable information (PII). \n \nUnfortunately the current approach of data collection where aggregation only happens on the backend of the collector makes these side effects unavoidable. \nAt Cliqz we faced the same problem when designing our data collection system. We needed data from our users to build our services: a browser with an integrated search engine, news recommendation, security services such as anti-phishing and anti-tracking and so on. However, we were very troubled by the side-effects. \nThat is why we created the framework \u2013 Human-Web[1] , a novel approach to data collection that relies on client-side aggregation rather than server-side. Since server-side aggregation of user's data is bound to produce side-effects, it is strictly forbidden. \nOur data collection backend only receives signals from our users if and only if those signals require no further aggregation. If aggregation by user is required, it will be carried out in the client itself. Thus no UID ever reaches our data collection backend. In addition to remove explicit UIDs we have a complex set of heuristics to detect potential implicit UIDs in the content of the signals as well. \nThis talk, however, is not just about how we at Cliqz build privacy preserving data collection systems, which have been running in production for over two years now, the whole motivation behind this talk is to showcase design choices and exciting new technologies that can help anyone collect and transport data in a privacy preserving manner which can be useful for any number of uses cases, for instance one can use the same approach to build a privacy-preserving google analytics (as can be showcased in a demo) and solve problems like re-targeting, complex telemetry for business intelligence, goal conversions or like in our case building a complete search-engine. \nThe intended audience for this talk is anyone who deals with data, as a takeaway they will learn how by a slight change in the methodology data can be collected in a much much saner and safer way ultimately protecting and respecting the user's privacy. \nActually to demonstrate further, we have built a demo Google Analytics[2] service that covers a wide-range of metrics that require would require tracking to solve not so trivial use cases like  unique, goal completion, return rate, time on page, etc, but instead it relies on the principles of privacy by design and yet achieves what services like Google analytics will. \n \nFootnotes: \n[1] : https://cliqz.com/en/whycliqz/human-web \n[2] : http://josepmpujol.net/public/papers/big_green_tracker.pdf",

In dem Vortrag soll ein Abriss gegeben werden, welche Kriterien zu betrachten und welche Ma\u00dfnahmen zu ergreifen sind.

Und dort dr\u00fcben sehen Sie einen Schwarm zwitschernder Social-Media-Buttons \u2013 wie soll man da noch den \u00dcberblick behalten?\n\nIn diesem Vortrag m\u00f6chten wir unseren automatisierten Web-Scanner PrivacyScore vorstellen. PrivacyScore ist ein frei verf\u00fcgbares (GPLv3+) Werkzeug f\u00fcr interessierte Hobby-Botaniker*innen, das die Beobachtung diverser Gattungen dieser faszinierenden Kreaturen in der freien Wildbahn erm\u00f6glicht. W\u00e4hrend sich bislang viele darauf konzentrieren, den Trackern und Werbebannern durch hohe Z\u00e4une den Eintritt in ihren Garten zu verwehren, sind wir an ihrem nat\u00fcrlichen Lebensraum und der Artenvielfalt interessiert. Eine Auswahl m\u00f6glicher Forschungsfragen, die wir mit unserer Methodik beantworten k\u00f6nnen:\n\n* Welche Branchen bieten eine besonders reiche F\u00fclle an Werbenetzwerken und Trackern?\n* Welche G\u00e4rten sind mit TLS-Schl\u00f6ssern abgesichert, und wie hochqualitativ sind diese Schl\u00f6sser?\n* Und welche unserer Nachbarn haben vergessen, den Wildwuchs an Datenbank-Backups, PHPInfo-Seiten und Git-Repositories auf ihrer Webseite zu stutzen?\n\nWir sind vor allem an komparativen Analysen interessiert. Daher erm\u00f6glicht unser System L\u00e4ngs- und Querschnittstudien, um verschiedene Webseiten zu vergleichen. Wenn ihr euch also schon l\u00e4nger gefragt habt, welcher CCC-Erfa die am saubersten konfigurierte Webseite hat, oder welche deutsche Gro\u00dfstadt die wenigsten (oder meisten!) Tracker auf ihrer Webseite verwendet, habt ihr ab jetzt dazu die M\u00f6glichkeit. Und nat\u00fcrlich k\u00f6nnen unternehmungslustige Hobbybotaniker*innen das Projekt jederzeit erweitern \u2013 holt euch also gerne einen Ableger und beginnt eure eigene Zucht.\n\nPrivacyScore befindet sich momentan noch in Entwicklung, und viele Auswertungsfunktionen werden erst in den kommenden Monaten entstehen. Dieser Talk soll eine Einf\u00fchrung in den aktuellen Stand bieten und die M\u00f6glichkeiten aufzeigen, die das System bietet - von der pers\u00f6nlichen Neugierde bis hin zu Datenschutz-Aktivismus.\n\nLinks:\n\n* PrivacyScore.org\n* github.com/PrivacyScore/PrivacyScore",
