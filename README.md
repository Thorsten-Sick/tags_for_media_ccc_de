# State

**I am using this repo to test several CI/CD features. This will lead to a large refactoring of this whole project.
My goal: Do not break this tool. But also: Things will look crazy for some time till it gets better.**

# Directory structure

* tagger: The main project directory
* test: unit tests
* data: data generated by the project
* manufactured_data: manually generated data and config files
* out: generated output data

# Task

A small DB tagging media.ccc.de videos.

As I do not know which format is required I wrote all the data into a python
program - that way it can be exported in any format.

# Calling it

Frab only:
./dropdata.py --frab --out frab

# Data sources

## FRAB data bases (XML)

## subtitles

mirror.selfnet.de

## Usage

Getting statistics:
./dropdata.py --frab --statistics


## Development

### Running tox tests

Just call *tox*

### Travis on Github

Configuration for the Travis CI is in .github/workflows.

The two config files are run on:

* Push to master
* Doing a PR

### Running unittests

*python -m unittest discover* will find the unit tests in the *test* directory and run them. They are based on: 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

### Virtual Env and requirements

TODO: Enter/exit Venv (because I will use it a lot more)

TODO: Building packages (local, remote)
